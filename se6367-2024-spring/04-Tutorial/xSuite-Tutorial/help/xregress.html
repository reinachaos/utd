      xRegress: A Tool for Effective Regression
      Testing</a>
    </h1>
    <p>
      <a name="769964">The purpose of regression testing is to ensure that
      changes made to software, such as adding new features or modifying
      existing features, do not adversely affect features of the software that
      should not change. It is not cost-effective to rerun all the tests in a
      regression suite; a method is needed to reduce the testing effort.
      <em>xRegress</em> is just such a tool which
      supports test set minimization and test prioritization. It helps testers
      identify a representative subset of tests which should be re-executed to
      revalidate modified software.</a>

    <h2>
      <a name="773230">11.1 Background</a>
    </h2><a name="770688">No matter how well conceived and tested software is,
    it will eventually have to be modified in order to fix bugs or respond to
    changes in user specifications. Regression testing must be conducted to
    confirm that recent program changes have not adversely affected existing
    features and new tests must be created to test new features. Testers might
    rerun <em>all</em> test cases generated at earlier stages to ensure that
    the program behaves as expected. However, as a program evolves the
    regression test set grows larger, <em>old</em> tests are rarely discarded,
    and the expense of regression testing grows. Repeating all previous test
    cases in regression testing after each minor software revision or patch is
    often impossible due to time pressure and budget constraints. On the other
    hand, for software revalidation, arbitrarily omitting test cases used in
    regression testing is risky. Thus, we need to investigate methods to select
    small subsets of effective fault-revealing regression test cases to
    revalidate software. It is for this purpose that <em>xRegress</em>, 
	a test set minimization and prioritization
    tool, was developed.</a>
    <p>
      <a name="774374"><em>xRegress</em> supports test
      set <em>minimization</em> to reduce the number of test cases contained in
      a test set without loss of code coverage. In other words, it minimizes a
      test set to find a <em>minimal subset</em> in terms of the number of test
      cases that preserves the code coverage with respect to a certain
      criterion (<em>block and decision</em> as explained in</a> <a href=
      "overview.html#623861">Section 3.3, <em>What Does ATAC Do?</em></a>) of
      the original test set. <em>xRegress</em> also
      supports test set <em>prioritization</em> by sorting tests in increasing
      order of additional coverage per cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="774868">For test set minimization, <em>xRegress</em> 
	  uses an implicit enumeration algorithm with
      reductions to find the optimal subset based on all tests examined. In
      addition, to determine the exact minimized subset, <em>xRegress</em> 
	  also provides options to select a fast but
      approximate solution based on <em>greedy</em> heuristics in case the
      exact solution is not obtained in reasonable time. For test set
      prioritization, <em>xRegress</em> first selects a
      test case which gives the maximal coverage with respect to a given
      criterion per unit cost. Subsequent tests are selected based on their
      additional coverage per unit cost.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="774450">When testers can only afford to re-execute a few
      regression tests, they can either use every test case in the minimized
      subset for software revalidation or select as many tests as possible on
      the basis of test case priority, i.e., starting from the top of the
      prioritized test list. The rationale behind these two techniques is the
      following:</a>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a name="774509">The <em>correlation</em> between the fault detection
        capability of a test set and its code coverage on a program is higher
        than that between the fault detection capability and test set size.
        Insufficient testing such as long hours of test case execution that do
        not increase code coverage can lead to an incorrect assessment of
        program reliability.<br>
        <br></a> <a name="774884"></a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a name="774884">No matter how a test set is generated, its minimized
        test sets have a <em>size/effectiveness</em> advantage over the
        original set in terms of fewer test cases with little or no compromise
        in the strength of revealing faults.<br>
        <br></a> <a name="774659"></a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a name="774659">In general, a reduced set of tests selected by
        minimization/prioritization can detect faults not detected by a reduced
        set of the same size selected in a random or arbitrary way. Null
        hypothesis testing indicates that such effectiveness of
        minimization/prioritization over randomization does not just happen by
        chance.<br>
        <br></a>
      </li>
    </ol><a name="774908">In practice, depending on the available resources, a
    trade-off between what we can do in regression testing and what we can
    afford to do is applied to determine which test, among those necessary,
    should be re-executed first, and which one has lower priority or is to be
    omitted from re-execution. Our experience suggests that although neither
    test set minimization nor prioritization can reduce the cost of testing the
    current release, it may significantly reduce the cost of testing future
    releases of a software system. This savings arises because less time is
    spent maintaining, documenting, executing, and evaluating the output of
    smaller test sets.</a>

    <!-- The same wordcount program as
    used before is used here. To copy these files, create a new directory,
    <em>cd</em> to it, and copy the contents of the directory in which the
    tutorial files are installed into the new directory. For the illustrations
    in this chapter, we will use: (1) two <em>c</em> files: <em>main.c</em> and
    <em>wc.c</em>, (2) three data files: <em>input1</em>, <em>input2</em>, and
    <em>input3</em>, (3) the <em>Makefile</em> and (4)
    the <em>tests_regress</em> script. Compile the <em>wordcount</em> program
    with ATAC. Refer to</a> <a href="appendixB.html#1001045">Appendix A,
    <em>Platform Specific Information</em></a> to determine the correct command
    to execute for your setup.
    <p>
      <a name="787902">After the compilation, two <em>.atac</em> files
		  (<em>main.atac</em> for <em>main.c</em> and <em>wc.atac</em> for

		  (<em>wordcount.atacp</em>), and the executable <em>wordcount(.exe)</em> are created.
		  Note, one <em>.atac</em> file is created for each instrumented
		  <em>.c</em> file, i.e., the <em>.c</em> files compiled with ATAC, and one
		  <em>.atacp</em> file is created for each executable generated during the build process.</a>
