  ATAC: Executing Software Tests<br>
  <br></a></h1><a name="948453"></a>

  <p><a name="948454">When a program that has been compiled with
  ATAC is executed, in addition to its normal output, it generates
  coverage information that is appended to a trace file. The
  information within this file is later used by the graphical
  interface <em>xSuite</em> and the command
  line browser <em>atac</em> to produce coverage displays and
  reports. This chapter discusses how to manipulate the trace file
  and identifies problems that might occur during test
  execution.</a></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="943081">6.1 Naming the Trace File</a></h2><a name=
  "947315">By default, execution of a program compiled with ATAC
  creates a trace file in the current directory. The default trace
  file name is <em>prog.trace</em> , where <em>prog</em> is the
  name of the executable program under test.</a>

  <p>The executable name that is used as the basis for the trace
  file name is either: 1) a name that was explicitly specified to
  the ATAC compiler using the appropriate command-line option (see
  <a href="instrumenting.html#203798">Section 5.1.1, <em>Basic
  Instrumentation</em></a>); 2) the default executable name of
  <em>a.out</em>.</p>

  <p><a name="947316">The trace file name can also be specified via
  the setting of the environment variable, <em>ATAC_TRACE</em>. If
  this variable is set, its value is always used as as the basis of
  the trace file name. If the value of ATAC_TRACE ends with the
  proper suffix, <em>.trace</em>, then that value will be used
  identically as the trace file name; else, the suffix will be
  appended to the value to form the trace file name. Note that
  trace file names may not begin with a hyphen (-).</a></p>

  <p><a name="947316">If an executable file is later renamed, the
  name of its trace file will still be based upon the original
  name, and the trace information from further test runs will
  continue to be appended to the original trace file. However, the
  name of the trace file can be overridden to correspond to the new
  executable name by setting the ATAC_TRACE environment variable to
  the desired trace file name before the next test is
  executed.</a></p>

  <p><a name="947316"></a><a name="943005">The trace file may be
  written in a directory other than the current directory by
  setting the ATAC_DIR environment variable with a path to the
  desired directory. ATAC_DIR may be set to either an absolute or
  relative path.</a></p>

  <h2><a name="943113">6.2 Trace File Compression</a></h2><a name=
  "950127">When a test case is run on a program instrumented with
  ATAC, trace information is collected in a temporary trace file. A
  reference to this temporary trace file is appended to the
  "master" trace file. By default, ATAC compresses the trace file
  after each test execution.To save execution time at the expense
  of some disk space, automatic trace compression can be disabled
  by setting the environment variable ATAC_COMPRESS to <em>no</em>
  prior to program execution. In addition, the frequency of
  compression can be set to approximately every <em>n</em> files by
  setting the value to an integer, <em>n.</em> To restore automatic
  trace compression after each test execution, unset the
  ATAC_COMPRESS environment variable or set it to <em>yes</em>.
  (See</a> <a href="setup.html#107528">Section 4.1.2,
  <em>ATAC_COMPRESS</em></a>). It should be noted that the
  compressed trace file format used by ATAC is not the same as that
  used by general purpose file compression tools.

  <h3><a name="950138">6.2.1 Forcing Trace File
  Compression</a></h3><a name="950139">Whenever the ATAC_COMPRESS
  environment variable is set to <em>no</em>, it is advisable to
  periodically force trace file compression between test
  executions. This will prevent the trace file from growing too
  large.</a>

  <p><a name="949853">In addition, if the nature of a program or a
  set of tests is such that many executions exit abnormally (e.g.,
  via receipt of a signal), the trace file may not be compressed
  prior to program exit. In this case, trace file compression
  should periodically be forced even if ATAC_COMPRESS has not been
  set.</a></p>

  <p><a name="949854">If invoked with a <em>.trace</em> file as its
  argument, the <em>atactm</em> command performs trace file
  compression (see</a> <a href="managing.html#973910">Section 7.8,
  <em>Concerning Trace File Compression</em></a>). This offers a
  simple way to force trace file compression, regardless of whether
  or not the ATAC_COMPRESS environment variable is set. For
  example, invoking <em>atactm</em> as follows:</p>
  <pre>
<a name="949858">  prompt:&gt; atactm wordcount.trace<br></a>
</pre><a name="949859">forces the compression of
<em>wordcount.trace</em>.</a>

  <h2><a name="949785">6.3 Temporary Trace Files</a></h2><a name=
  "949786">The temporary trace file is normally created in the
  <em>/usr/tmp</em> directory. This can be overridden by setting
  the ATAC_TMP environment variable before linking or running the
  instrumented program. On some systems performance will suffer if
  the temporary trace file is written to an NFS mounted file
  system.</a>

  <p><a name="949787">The temporary trace file will not be
  incorporated into the master trace file if:</a></p>

  <ul>
    <li><a name="949788">The ATAC_COMPRESS environment variable is
    set to <em>0</em> or <em>no</em>.<br>
    <br></a> <a name="949789"></a></li>

    <li><a name="949789">The instrumented program terminates
    abnormally.<br>
    <br></a> <a name="949790"></a></li>

 	   
 	<li><a name="949790">The master trace file is locked. The master
   trace file may be locked for the following reasons:<br>
	      
	      <ul>
	      <li></a> <a name="949791">The trace file is being
	      compressed by another program.</a></li>
	
	      <li><a name="949795">The trace file is being browsed
	      with the graphical interface.</a></li>
	
	      <li><a name="949796">The lock file was not deleted due
	      to a previous abnormal termination of the graphical interface
	      or the <em>atactm</em> compression tool.</a></li>	
      </ul>    

    <li><a name="949800">There is not enough disk space available
    to incorporate the temporary trace file into the master trace
    file.<br>
    <br></a> <a name="949801"></a></li>

    <li><a name="949801">The temporary trace file is not readable
    (e.g. the file system is not mounted) at the time the
    compression tool is run.<br>
    <br></a></li>
  </ul><a name="949802">The temporary trace file will be
  automatically incorporated into the master trace file except
  under the conditions listed above.</a>

  <h2><a name="949831">6.4 Trace File Locking</a></h2><a name=
  "949832">A trace file must be locked to prevent concurrent
  attempts to compress or edit the trace file (e.g. with
  <em>atactm</em>) and to permit the graphical interface to process
  concurrent trace file changes efficiently.</a>

  <p><a name="950101">The lock is a file in the same directory as
  the trace file with the same name as the trace file except that
  the <em>.trace</em> suffix is replaced with
  <em>.AElock</em>.</a></p>

  <p><a name="950103">If the lock file exists or cannot be created
  (due to directory permissions), tools that did not create the
  lock cannot edit or compress the trace file. In addition, if the
  graphical interface cannot create the lock and test cases are
  still running, the whole trace file will have to be reread every
  time the "<em>Update</em>" button is selected.</a></p>

  <p><a name="949835">Normally the lock file is automatically
  deleted by the tool that created the lock. If the tool terminates
  abnormally, the lock file may not be deleted. The lock file may
  be deleted manually.</a></p>

  <p><a name="949836">Note that locking is not needed to prevent
  trace file corruption. If it becomes necessary to "force" a lock,
  due to apparent failure of its owner, the resulting trace may
  become incomplete but will not become corrupted.</a></p>

  <h2><a name="949930">6.5 Trace File Permission</a></h2><a name=
  "949932">In the Windows environment, permissions are generally
  not an issue because of the single-user nature of the setup. If
  you are working in a multi-user Windows environment, check with
  your system administrator regarding file security. It is notable
  that the ownership of a trace file changes to the last user who
  compressed it.</a>

  <p><a name="949896">In the Linux environment, the master trace
  file is created with the same read/write permissions for
  user/group/other as the directory it is created in. Compression
  will preserve the read/write permissions on the trace
  file.</a></p>

  <p><a name="949868">Temporary trace files are created with the
  same permissions as the trace file that points to it.</a></p>

  <p><a name="949869">For example, if the directory the trace file
  is created in is readable and writable by user and group (0770),
  the trace file and temporary trace files are created readable and
  writable by user and group (0660) when a test is run by anyone in
  the group. The same trace file may be appended and/or compressed
  by anyone in the group.</a></p>

  <p><a name="949870">If the ATAC_UMASK environment variable is set
  before linking or execution, it should be set to an octal number
  from 0 to 0666. The value is used to restrict the permissions on
  the trace file, e.g. if the directory to contain the trace file
  has permissions 0775 and ATAC_UMASK is 026 then the trace file is
  created with permission 0640.</a></p>

  <p><a name="949871">Note that the ownership of the trace file
  changes to the last one who compressed it. This shouldn't matter
  as long as the permissions for group or other permit reading and
  writing.</a></p>

  <p><a name="949872">Note also, that if a directory has the
  "sticky bit" set, files can be deleted from the directory only by
  the owner (regardless of file and directory permissions). This
  bit is often set on <em>/tmp</em> and <em>/usr/tmp</em> so that
  people can't delete each others temporary files even though
  everybody can write the directory. If this bit is set on the
  directory where ATAC is putting the temporary trace files, and
  there are multiple users writing to the same trace file, during
  compression, some of the temporary trace files will not get
  deleted. When this happens, <em>atactm</em> truncates the files
  to size zero to save disk space and as an indication that the
  file is no longer needed.</a></p>

  <h2><a name="949864">6.6 Parallel Test Execution</a></h2><a name=
  "947338">ATAC supports parallel test execution. When multiple
  instances of a program instrumented with ATAC are executed in
  parallel, writing to the same trace file, ATAC will maintain
  separate trace data for each in the trace file.</a>

  <h2><a name="947348">6.7 Improving Execution Speed and Saving
  Disk Space</a></h2><a name="943105">Programs compiled under ATAC
  execute more slowly, require more memory, and occupy more disk
  space than when compiled with the standard C compiler (see</a>
  <a href="overview.html#623840">Section 3.5, <em>What Will Using
  ATAC Cost You?</em></a>). The time required for program execution
  may be reduced, at a cost of some disk space, by not compressing
  the trace file between each test execution. If automatic trace
  file compression is turned off, it is advisable to periodically
  force compression in order to reduce the size of the trace file
  (see <a href="executing.html#950138">Section 6.2.1, <em>Forcing
  Trace File Compression</em></a>).

  <p><a name="943052">The impact of ATAC on execution speed and
  disk space may also be reduced by limiting the scope of coverage
  analysis to a subset of the source files in the program under
  test (see</a> <a href="instrumenting.html#203817">Section 5.1.3,
  <em>Selectively Instrumenting Software</em></a> (Linux) or
  <a href="instrumenting.html#204433">Section 5.2.3,
  <em>Selectively Instrumenting Software</em></a> (Windows)). Using
  this approach, normal program performance only degrades while
  executing code within the source files compiled with ATAC.
  Coverage analysis of an entire software system is obtained by
  combining the results of executing identical tests on a number of
  source file subsets, each selectively instrumented in a
  complementary manner.</p>

  <p><a name="943104">If testing is being conducted in a network
  environment where remote file systems are being accessed from a
  file server, execution time may also be reduced by directing the
  trace file to a file on a local disk (see</a> <a href=
  "executing.html#943081">Section 6.1, <em>Naming the Trace
  File</em></a>). This eliminates network file access time when
  writing to the trace file. If ATAC_TMP is set, it should also
  point to a directory on a local disk (see <a href=
  "setup.html#107556">Section 4.1.6, <em>ATAC_TMP</em></a>).</p>

  <p><a name="947457">Execution time may also be reduced by
  restricting the amount of detail in the coverage data. In
  particular, if only block coverage data is needed, execution time
  may be reduced by setting ATAC_BLOCKONLY to <em>yes</em> (see</a>
  <a href="setup.html#107510">Section 4.1.1,
  <em>ATAC_BLOCKONLY</em></a>).</p>

  <h2>6.8 Explaining Run-Time Errors</h2><a name="947538">A program
  compiled with ATAC should exhibit behavior identical to the same
  program compiled with the standard C compiler, with the following
  exceptions:<br></a>

  <ul>
 
    <li><a name="943088">The program compiled with ATAC will create
    or append to a trace file (see</a> <a href=
    "executing.html#943081">Section 6.1, <em>Naming the Trace
    File</em></a>).<br>
    <br>
    <a name="943111"></a></li>

    <li><a name="943111">The program compiled with ATAC will
    execute somewhat more slowly than the original program. If the
    program is timing sensitive, this may cause other behavioral
    differences (see</a> <a href="overview.html#623840">Section
    3.5, <em>What Will Using ATAC Cost You?</em></a> and <a href=
    "executing.html#947348">Section 6.7, <em>Improving Execution
    Speed and Saving Disk Space</em></a>).<br>
    <br>
    <a name="943115"></a><a name="943117"></a></li>

    <li><a name="943117">Programs that appear to behave correctly
    sometimes contain memory violations which, by chance, do not
    interfere with program execution (e.g., accessing unallocated
    memory locations). When ATAC is used, these violations may
    begin to interfere with program execution and result in program
    failure. Conversely, memory violations that would normally
    result in program failure may be masked when using ATAC.<br>
