  ATAC: Managing Your Test Cases<br>
  <br></a></h1><a name="979923"></a>

  <p><a name="979924">When a program is compiled with ATAC,
  coverage information is appended to a trace file each time the
  resulting executable is tested. This information records the time
  of test case execution, what is covered, and the occurrence of
  any abnormal conditions (e.g., trace file corruption). This
  chapter discusses how to manage your test cases by manipulating
  the contents of the trace file.</a></p>
  <hr>

  <p><a name="973960">The contents of an ATAC trace file are not in
  human-readable form. However, the ATAC trace manager,
  <em>atactm</em>, can be used to manipulate its contents.
  <em>Atactm</em> can list, rename, extract, delete, and assign
  cost to test cases. Each of these operations can be qualified to
  apply to a selective subset of test cases within a trace file.
  Listing test cases is a display operation. Renaming, deleting, or
  assigning cost to tests can either be performed in-place,
  effecting the existing trace file, or the results can be directed
  to a new trace file. Extracting one or more test cases means to
  select and copy them to a new trace file.

  <h2><a name="973880">7.1 Listing Test Cases</a></h2><a name=
  "973878">A list of all the tests represented in a given trace
  file is obtained using the <em>-l</em> or <em>-L</em> command-
  line options. For example, assuming that four test cases have
  been executed against the <em>wordcount</em> program, invoking
  <em>atactm</em> on <em>wordcount.trace</em> with the <em>-l</em>
  option:</a>
  <pre>
<a name="973833">  prompt:&gt; atactm -l wordcount.trace<br></a>
</pre><a name="973911">yields an abbreviated list of, in this case,

conjunction with shell scripts to aid in performing actions on
large numbers of test cases. Using <em>-L</em> provides more
information. The test list contains six or seven columns for each
test providing the execution date-time and duration of the test,
the version of ATAC used, a user-assigned test cost (the default is
100), test trace attributes (---------- for none), the test name,
and the uncompressed trace file if applicable.The significance of
test cost is discussed in the</a> <a href=

  </ul><a name="973879">Like the other <em>atactm</em> operations,
  test cases can be selectively listed by using the <em>-n</em> and
  <em>-x</em> command-line options along with the <em>-l</em> or
  <em>-L</em> options.The use of these options in selecting
  specific test cases is discussed in</a> <a href=
  "managing.html#973941">Section 7.2, <em>Selecting Test
  Cases</em></a>.

  <h2><a name="973941">7.2 Selecting Test Cases</a></h2><a name=
  "973943"><em>Atactm</em> operates on the information within a
  trace file corresponding to one or more test cases. The supported
  operations (e.g., list, rename, delete, etc.) can be performed on
  all tests, or selectively, on a subset of the existing tests.
  This is achieved using the <em>-n</em> option to select the tests
  on which the operation is to be applied. For example, assume the
  same four tests as listed in</a> <a href=
  "managing.html#973880">Section 7.1, <em>Listing Test
  Cases</em></a>, have been executed against the <em>wordcount</em>
  program. The first two of these tests are listed by entering:
  <pre>
<a name=
"973944">  prompt:&gt; atactm -l -n wordcount.1 -n wordcount.2 wordcount.trace<br></a>
</pre><a name="973945">which results in the following output:</a>
  <pre>
<a name="973946">  wordcount.1   wordcount.2<br></a>
</pre><a name="973950">Notice that multiple <em>-n</em> arguments
may be submitted on a single command-line. In such a case, the
union of all the tests named are selected. Tests can also be named
using wild card characters. These wild cards are the same as those
used by the Linux-like command processor in naming files <em>(*, ?,
[...])</em>. So, entering the appropriate command below:</a>
  <pre>
   prompt:&gt; atactm -l -n 'word*.[1-2]' wordcount.trace (Linux)<br>or<br>   prompt:&gt; atactm -l -n word*.[1-2] wordcount.trace (Windows)<br>
</pre>

  <p><a name="981399">results in the same listing as the previous
  example. In some cases, quote marks may be needed to prevent the
  shell from expanding the test names as file names.</a></p>

  <p><a name="973957">Sometimes it is necessary to select all tests
  other than those that have been named. The <em>-x</em> option is
  used to select the compliment of all tests specified using one or
  more instances of the<em>-n</em> option. For example,
  entering:</a></p>
  <pre>
   prompt:&gt; atactm -l -x -n 'word*.[1-2]' wordcount.trace (Linux)<br>or<br>   prompt:&gt; atactm -l -x -n word*.[1-2] wordcount.trace (Windows)<br>
</pre>

  <p><a name="973953">lists the third and fourth test cases, which
  were excluded from the output of the previous examples:</a></p>
  <pre>
<a name="973955">  wordcount.3   wordcount.4<br></a>
</pre>

  <h2><a name="973912">7.3 Naming Test Cases</a></h2><a name=
  "973920">By default, tests are named <em>prog.n</em>, where
  <em>prog</em> is the base name of the trace file and <em>n</em>
  is a number starting at 1. Unique numeric values are appended to
  all test names so that two tests never have the same name in a
  given trace file. See</a> <a href="managing.html#973880">Section
  7.1, <em>Listing Test Cases</em></a>, for an example listing of
  default test names.

  <p><a name="973931">A test can also be named explicitly by
  setting the ATAC_TEST environment variable to the test name prior
  to execution (see</a> <a href="setup.html#107549">Section 4.1.5,
  <em>ATAC_TEST</em></a>). Valid test names consist of letters,
  digits, and underscores. As with default test names, a numeric
  suffix is added to the name automatically to make it unique (a
  numeric suffix should not be specified in the value of
  ATAC_TEST). For example, testing <em>wordcount</em> by
  entering:</p>
  <pre>
   prompt:&gt; ATAC_TEST=empty wordcount empty (Linux)<br>or<br>   prompt:&gt; set ATAC_TEST=empty <br>   prompt:&gt; wordcount empty       (Windows)<br>
</pre>

  <p><a name="973929">results in the creation of a new test case
  named <em>empty.1</em>, as shown by the <em>-l</em>
  listing:</a></p>
  <pre>
<a name=
"979030">  wordcount.1  wordcount.2  wordcount.3  wordcount.4  empty.1<br></a>
</pre>

  <h3><a name="973933">7.3.1 Renaming Test Cases</a></h3><a name=
  "973919">An existing test can be renamed using the <em>-r</em>
  option of <em>atactm</em>. For example, assume the
  <em>wordcount</em> tests <em>wordcount.1</em> through
  <em>wordcount.</em>4 are respectively designed to test each of
  the legal command-line options for <em>wordcount</em>. These
  options are <em>-w, -c, -l,</em> and <em>-?</em>. A more
  meaningful set of test names can be provided in
  <em>wordcount.trace</em> by entering the following series of
  commands:</a>
  <pre>   prompt:&gt; atactm -r w_option -n wordcount.1 wordcount.trace<br>   prompt:&gt; atactm -r c_option -n wordcount.2 wordcount.trace<br>   prompt:&gt; atactm -r l_option -n wordcount.3 wordcount.trace<br>   prompt:&gt; atactm -r q_option -n wordcount.4 wordcount.trace<br>
</pre><a name="973942">Now listing the test cases represented in
<em>wordcount.trace</em> results in:</a>
  <pre>
<a name=
"979046">  w_option.1   c_option   l_option.1   q_option.1   empty.1<br></a>
</pre><a name="979047">The <em>-r</em> option specifies the new
test name, while the <em>-n</em> option selects the old test to be
renamed. A group of tests may also be renamed using wild cards,
multiple instances of the <em>-n</em> option, or the <em>-x</em>
option to name the old tests (see</a> <a href=
"managing.html#973941">Section 7.2, <em>Selecting Test
Cases</em></a>, for more details). For example, to rename the tests
from the last example so their names are all related, enter:
  <pre>
   prompt:&gt; atactm -r option_test -n '*_option.*' wordcount.trace (Linux)<br>or<br>   prompt:&gt; atactm -r option_test -n *_option.* wordcount.trace (Windows)<br>
</pre>

  <p><a name="979070">Listing the test cases represented in
  <em>wordcount.trace</em> now results in:</a></p>
  <pre>
<a name="979071">   option_test.1  option_test.3  empty.1<br>   option_test.2  option_test.4<br></a>
</pre><a name="979057">Note that, to guarantee uniqueness, a
different <em>.n</em> suffix has been appended to the new test name
for each test case. Make sure that only the desired test names
match when using wild cards, otherwise multiple test cases can be
unintentionally renamed.</a>

  <h3><a name="973925">7.3.2 What's in a Name?</a></h3><a name=
  "973972">ATAC supports the notion of a test case as a collection
  of trace information associated with a single program execution.
  Furthermore, ATAC provides a set of operations that can be
  selectively applied to each test case's trace information.
  However, ATAC has no concept of how a specific test case is
  intended to test a program, nor does ATAC manage test case setup,
  inputs, or outputs.</a>

  <p><a name="981231">Test names are what link ATAC trace
  information with the test plan for a program. It is important to
  name test cases so that it is possible to identify what they are
  designed to test, what setup is required to make them run, where
  their inputs and outputs are located, and so on. While executing
  tests, the tester should keep track of all the required
  information and map it to the appropriate ATAC test names.
  Descriptive test case names may facilitate this process. Doing so
  will help to make tests repeatable and facilitate test set
  minimization (see</a> <a href="xregress.html#770329">Section
  11.2, <em>Test set minimization via a character-based user
  interface</em></a>), both of which aid in regression testing.</p>

  <h2><a name="981240">7.4 Extracting Test Cases and Merging Trace
  Files</a></h2><a name="973963">Test cases can be selectively
  extracted from an existing trace file and copied to a new trace
  file using the <em>-e</em> command-line option. Extracting test
  cases copies data to a new trace file without deleting those test
  cases from the original trace file. For example, trace
  information for the test case named <em>wordcount.1</em> is
  copied from <em>wordcount.trace</em> and placed in
  <em>new.trace</em> by entering:</a>
  <pre>
<a name=
"973965">  prompt:&gt; atactm -e -n option_test.1 -o new.trace wordcount.trace<br></a>
</pre><a name="979105">The <em>-n</em> and <em>-o</em> options are
required in order to select the test case(s) of interest and
specify their destination. In addition, the <em>-x</em> argument
may optionally be used (see</a> <a href=
"managing.html#973941">Section 7.2, <em>Selecting Test
Cases</em></a>). Note that, if <em>new.trace</em> already exists,
it is overwritten and will now only contain test case
<em>wordcount.1</em>.

  <p><a name="979090"><em>Atactm</em> may be used to merge trace
  files. To merge <em>new.trace</em> and <em>wordcount.trace</em>
  into <em>merge.trace</em> enter:</a></p>
  <pre>
<a name=
"979095">  prompt:&gt; atactm -o merge.trace wordcount.trace new.trace<br></a>
</pre><a name="979104">In this case, <em>merge.trace</em> now
contains two copies of the first test case: the copy from
<em>wordcount.trace</em>, which is named <em>option_test.1</em> and
the copy from <em>new.trace</em> which has been renamed
<em>option_test.5</em>. Note that tests with the same name are
renumbered to ensure that two test cases do not have the same name.
If the <em>-o</em> option is omitted, the first trace file is
overwritten by the merged trace file.</a>

  <h2><a name="973909">7.5 Deleting Test Cases</a></h2><a name=
  "973849">From time-to-time, it may become necessary to delete
  trace information corresponding to specific test executions. This
  may occur if the program under test is modified (see</a> <a href=
  "managing.html#973974">Section 7.7, <em>Dealing with Source Code
  Modifications</em></a>).

  <p><a name="973927">Deleting an entire trace file discards the
  trace information for all tests whose executions are recorded in
  that file. Alternatively, trace information can be selectively
  discarded by invoking <em>atactm</em> with the <em>-d</em>
  command-line option. For example, trace information for the test
  case named <em>wordcount.1</em> is deleted from
  <em>wordcount.trace</em> by entering:</a></p>
  <pre>
<a name=
"973877">  prompt:&gt; atactm -d -n wordcount.1 wordcount.trace<br></a>
</pre><a name="973966">The <em>-n</em> option is required to select
the test case(s) to be deleted, and the <em>-x</em> argument may
optionally be used (see</a> <a href="managing.html#973941">Section
7.2, <em>Selecting Test Cases</em></a>). Alternatively, the result
after deleting test <em>wordcount.1</em> from
<em>wordcount.trace</em> is placed in <em>new.trace</em> by
entering:
  <pre>
<a name=
"973928">  prompt:&gt; atactm -d -n wordcount.1 -o new.trace wordcount.trace<br></a>
</pre><a name="973968">When the <em>-o</em> option is used, the
trace file <em>wordcount.trace</em> remains unchanged. If
<em>new.trace</em> already exists, it is overwritten and will now
contain all test cases in <em>wordcount.trace,</em> except for <em>
  wordcount.1</em>.</a>

  <h2><a name="973964">7.6 Assigning Cost to Test
  Cases</a></h2><a name="973969">ATAC associates a cost with each
  test case. By default, all tests are given an initial cost of
  100. However, invoking <em>atactm</em> with the <em>-c</em>
  command-line option allows the cost of each test to be
  selectively reassigned any non-negative value. This value is
  determined by the user and should reflect the relative difficulty
  and expense of executing the test case. Depending on the nature
  of the program under test, this may be a function of execution
  time, tester time, test setup time, or other factors. For
  example, assume that a large file called <em>/etc/termcap</em> is
  submitted to the <em>wordcount</em> program and this test is
  named <em>termcap.</em> Furthermore, assume we regard this test
  to be twice as expensive to run as the default test case. We can
  reassign the cost of <em>termcap</em> as 200 by entering:</a>
  <pre>
<a name=
"973967">  prompt:&gt; atactm -c 200 -n termcap wordcount.trace<br></a>
</pre><a name="973971">The <em>-n</em> option is required in order
to select the test case(s) of interest. In addition, the
<em>-x</em> argument may optionally be used for selection (see</a>
<a href="managing.html#973941">Section 7.2, <em>Selecting Test
Cases</em></a>), while the <em>-o</em> argument may optionally be
used to place the results in a new trace file.

  <p><a name="973970">The cost assignments of one or more test
  cases can be selectively displayed by invoking <em>atactm</em>
  using the <em>-L</em> command-line option (see</a> <a href=
  "managing.html#973880">Section 7.1, <em>Listing Test
  Cases</em></a>). ATAC uses these cost assignments to minimize the
  size of a test set based upon the relative cost and coverage
  characteristics of individual test cases (see <a href=
  "xregress.html#770329">Section 11.2, <em>Test set minimization
  via a character-based user interface</em></a>).</p>

  <h2><a name="973974">7.7 Dealing with Source Code
  Modifications</a></h2><a name="973932">If a source file is
  modified while testing is underway, ATAC's list of what needs to
  be covered within the file becomes out-of-date (see</a> <a href=
  "overview.html#623934">Section 3.4, <em>How Does ATAC
  Work?</em></a>). This source file must be recompiled and the
  program under test relinked using the ATAC compiler. Furthermore,
  test cases must be rerun because they may be out-of-date in
  relation to the new executable program.

  <p><a name="973947">It may not be convenient or cost-effective to
  repeatedly recompile after each source code modification. If
  recompilation is deferred pending additional changes, it is
  suggested that you make the modifications to source file copies,
  rather than the actual files originally compiled with ATAC. If
  the originals are modified, ATAC may no longer be able to display
  highlighted code fragments correctly. Warning messages signaling
  this are issued if an attempt is made to display code fragments
  within a file modified more recently than any of its trace
  information. However, the highlighted code fragments are still
  displayed in the event that minor code changes will not misalign
  the display too much. This permits coverage testing and display
  activities to continue prior to recompilation and in the face of
  minor source code changes, without copying files or rerunning
  previous test cases.</a></p>

  <p><a name="979182">When you rebuild the program under test you
  should delete the old trace file or the affected tests. If you
  forget to do this and begin to execute tests, you should either
  delete all test cases run prior to the rebuild (see</a> <a href=
  "managing.html#973909">Section 7.5, <em>Deleting Test
  Cases</em></a>) or extract all test cases run since the rebuild
  and overwrite the trace file (see <a href=
  "managing.html#981240">Section 7.4, <em>Extracting Test Cases and
  Merging Trace Files</em></a>). Otherwise, ATAC tools may output
  error messages identifying obsolete test cases. For example,
  after <em>wordcount</em> source file <em>main.c</em> is
  substantially modified and <em>wordcount</em> rebuilt, execution
  of the command:</p>
  <pre>

  <h2><a name="973910">7.8 Concerning Trace File
  Compression</a></h2><a name="973935">Trace file compression
  discards all redundant trace information within a trace file. If
  two distinct test cases overlap in terms of coverage, all trace
  information that redundantly records this coverage for each test
  case is consolidated and shared between the tests. This tends to
  reduce the size of the trace file. Moreover, if trace file
  compression is performed after each test execution, other than a
  small entry recording that a test has been run, the trace file
  only grows if a test case actually improves coverage.</a>

  <p><a name="973936">Each time <em>atactm</em> is invoked, if any
  options other than <em>-l</em> and <em>-L</em> are specified,
  including no options, the trace file is automatically compressed.
  For example, if <em>atactm</em> is invoked
  on<em>wordcount.trace</em> as follows, compression will
  occur:</a></p>

</pre><a name="973939">This feature is useful, under certain
conditions, as a means of forcing trace file compression (see</a>

Compression</em></a>).
