ATAC & xSuite: Generating Summary Reports
<br>
<br>
</h1>
</a><a name="994142">
</a>
<p><a name="991483">When a program is compiled with <em>atac</em>, a <em>.atac</em>
file
is generated for each instrumented source file, and coverage
information is appended to a trace file each time the compiled
executable is tested. Each <em>.atac</em> file contains a list of what
should be covered when testing its corresponding source file. The trace
file records what has actually been covered during testing. The graphical interface 
<em>xSuite</em> uses the same facilities as does the command-line browser <em>atac</em> in
reporting testing results, therefore the presentation of summary
reports for <em>atac</em> and <em>xSuite</em> are merged
in this chapter. This chapter discusses how to generate reports using
these files that summarize the current level of code coverage and what
each test case has contributed to this coverage. Such reports provide a
high-level view of how a test is progressing and the relative
contribution of each test case to the software testing effort.
</a></p>
<p><a name="484077">The character-based interface<em>, atac,</em>
accepts various
command-line options, one or more <em>.atac</em> files, and a trace
file as input. <em>atac</em> compares what should be covered in a
given source file to what has been covered and outputs its findings in
a variety of ways. The <em>-s</em> command-
line option is used to generate summary reports. Additional arguments
are used along with <em>-s</em> to further specify the contents and
format of a report.
</p>
<p><a name="994984">
In the graphical interface, <em>xSuite</em>,
summary
report selections are made by clicking the "<em>Summary</em>" button
in the
top button bar and selecting the appropriate coverage option.
The <em>.atac</em> and <em>.trace</em> files may be specified on the
command line. Currently only the <em>File</em>
menu in the the the <em>xSuite</em> session.
</a></p>
<p><a name="994999">
<h2>8.1 Generating Coverage Summaries
</h2>
</a><a name="995336">
To invoke <em>atac</em> in summary generation mode, use the <em>-s</em>
command-line option. For example, assume that the <em>wordcount</em>
program discussed in </a><a href="tutorial.html#402515">Chapter 2</a><em>,
</em>has been executed only against the following three tests:
</p>
<pre>	prompt:&gt; wordcount -l empty<br>	prompt:&gt; wordcount -w empty<br>	prompt:&gt; wordcount -c empty<br></pre>
<a name="987979">Then a summary of the current level of code coverage
is obtained by entering (for default trace file name on Windows):
</a>
<pre><a name="988030">	prompt:&gt; atac -s main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br></a><br></pre>
The summary report generated looks like this:
<pre><br><br>        % blocks      % decisions <br>        ------------- ------------- <br>        63(34/54)     49(17/35)     == total ==<br></pre>
<a name="991762">
This report indicates that, throughout all source files making up the <em>wordcount</em>
program, 67% of all blocks (34 of 51) and 49% of all decisions (17 of
35) have
been covered. </a>
<p><a name="991823"></a><a name="992150">The corresponding summary in
the graphical interface is provided in the "<em>Summary</em>" pane on 
lower left of the main window when "<em>Block coverage</em>" and "<em> By type</em>"
are selected from the controlling drop down menus.
</a><a href="generating.html#992150">Figure 8-1</a> shows the resulting
display. In any discussion involving <em>xSuite</em>
throughout this chapter, we will assume that the three test cases
mentioned above have been executed and <em>xSuite</em>
has been invoked using the following command:
</p>

    </div>

<p>
</p>
<pre><a name="991814">	prompt:&gt; xsuite wordcount.atacp<br></a></pre>
<a name="991902">Note that <em>xSuite</em>
displays the percentages as a bar chart. Each bar is actually made up
of two bars, one contained inside the other. The length of the outer
bar represents the maximum possible (100%) coverage for the
corresponding measure and that of the inner bar represents the actual
coverage attained so far for that measure. As the actual coverage
increases, the length of the inner bar increases accordingly.
</a>
<p><a name="991896">Both <em>atac</em> and <em>xSuite</em>
use standard rounding in reporting results except that 100% coverage and 0% coverage
are treated as special cases. No result is ever rounded up to 100% or
down to 0%. Also, whereas <em>atac</em> rounds percentages to whole numbers, 
<em>xSuite</em> rounds them to their first decimal places.
</a></p>
<p><a name="987648">
<h2>8.2 Selecting What to Summarize
</h2>
</a><a name="986232">
As mentioned earlier, <em>atac</em> uses various command-line options to specify
the summary format, and <em>xSuite</em> uses
various menus for the same purpose. You can break down the summary
information by file, by function, or by test case.
</a></p>
<p><a name="986183">
<h3>8.2.1 By File
</h3>
</a><a name="986233">
In the character-based interface, a coverage summary broken down by
source file is printed using the <em>-g</em> command-line option.
Assuming that the test cases of </a><a href="generating.html#994999">Section
8.1</a> have been executed, a per source file coverage summary for the <em>wordcount</em>
program is printed by entering:
</p>
<pre><a name="986234">	prompt:&gt; atac -sg main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br></a><br></pre>
The summary report generated looks like this:
<pre><br><br>        % blocks      % decisions   source file<br>        ------------- ------------- ------------- <br>        76(29/41)     70(16/23)     main.c<br>        38(5/13)      8(1/12)       wc.c<br>        67(34/54)     49(17/35)     == total ==<br><br></pre>
<a name="987996">
This right most column indicates whether the coverage levels presented
correspond to <em>main.c</em>, <em>wc.c</em>, or the union of all the
source files presented. Note that the <em>-g </em>command-line option
cannot be used along with the <em>-f</em> command-line option (see </a><a
 href="generating.html#992388">Section 8.2.2, <em>By Function</em></a>).
<p><a name="992351"></a><a name="992363">In the graphical interface, a
per file summary is
obtained by clicking the
"<em>Summary</em>" button, then selecting the "<em>by-file</em>"
coverage option. </a><a href="generating.html#992363">Figure 8-2</a>
shows the per file summary after the three tests mentioned above have
been executed. </p>
<!-- potential future enhancement 
Files listed in the "<em>Summary</em>" window can be
sorted in different ways. Clicking on "<em>Sort_by</em>" in the
middle button bar and selecting the "<em>name</em>" entry will sort
files by name in alpha-numeric order. The "<em>num_covered</em>," "<em>percentage_covered</em>,"
"<em>num_uncovered</em>," and "<em>percentage_uncovered</em>"
entries sort files by the number or percentage of testable attributes
covered or uncovered, respectively, according to the currently selected
coverage type. The entry "<em>num_total_units</em>" sorts files by
the total number of testable attributes with respect to the currently
selected coverage type. The "<em>default_order</em>" selection
performs the sort according to the order the <em>.atac</em> files
occurred on the command line; and the entry "<em>dont_sort</em>"
preserves the current state of the sort allowing new information to be
appended to the end.

<h2>8.3 Restricting Summary Information
</h2>
</a><a name="986245">
It is possible to restrict the information included in a summary by the
character-based interface in many ways. Restrictions are made by
controlling the <em>.atac</em> files submitted in the argument list
and using various command-line options. The graphical interface does
not offer any additional facilities for restricting the summary display
besides those discussed in </a><a href="generating.html#987648">Section
8.2,
<em>Selecting What to Summarize</em></a>. The options discussed
within this section may be used together freely.
</p>
<p><a name="986215">
<h3>8.3.1 By File
</h3>
</a><a name="484881">
The coverage summary generated by <em>atac</em> is limited to those <em>.atac</em>
files submitted in the argument list. For example, the per function
summary generated in </a><a href="generating.html#992388">Section 8.2.2</a>
is limited to those functions in <em>main.c</em> by entering:
</p>
<pre><a name="988104">	prompt:&gt; atac -sf main.atac wordcount.trace<br></a><br></pre>
The summary report generated looks like this:

<a name="484913">
<h3>8.3.2 By Function
</h3>
</a><a name="986249">
An <em>atac</em> summary is limited to a selected set of functions
using the <em>-F</em> command-line option. For example, the per
function summary generated in </a><a href="generating.html#992388">Section
8.2.2</a> is limited to the functions <em>main</em> and <em>count</em>
by entering:
<pre><a name="988124">	prompt:&gt; atac -sf -F main -F count main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br></a><br></pre>

<a name="986246">
Note that multiple functions may be specified by repeating the <em>-F</em>
option, and functions may be named using wild card characters. These
wild cards are the same as those used by the Linux-like command
processor in naming files<em> (*, ?, [...])</em>. In some cases, quote
marks may be needed to prevent the command processor from expanding the
test names as file names.

<p><a name="986230">
<h3>8.3.3 By Coverage Criteria
</h3>
</a><a name="986253">
An <em>atac</em> summary is limited to a selected set of coverage
measures using the <em>-m {bde}</em> command-line option. The
argument to <em>-m</em> selects one or more coverage measures: <em>e</em>
selects function-entry coverage, <em>b</em> block coverage, <em>d</em>
decision coverage (see </a><a href="overview.html#623861">Section 3.3,
<em>What Does <em>atac</em> Do?</em></a>,
for
an
explanation
of
these
measures). For example, the per function
summary generated in <a href="generating.html#992522">Figure 8-5</a>
is limited to block coverage by entering:

As mentioned in </a><a href="generating.html#992798">Section 8.2.3</a>,
in
the
character-based
interface,
the
<em>-p</em> command-line option

summarize coverage on a per test case basis. The character-based
interface also provides various other ways to display test case
coverage summaries. If you are following the examples in the first
three sections of this chapter, clear out the <em>.trace</em> file by
removing it. Then execute the <em>wordcount</em> program against the
following three test cases:

<h3>8.4.1 Including Cumulative Coverage
</h3>
</a><a name="986284">
Cumulative test case coverage is included in a summary using the <em>-q</em>
command-line option. For example, the following generates a cumulative
summary of the test cases presented above:
</a></p>
<pre><a name="986285">	prompt:&gt; atac -sq main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br></a><br></pre>
The summary report generated looks like this:
<pre><br><br>        % blocks      % decisions   test<br>        (cumulative)  (cumulative)    <br>        ------------- ------------- ------------- <br>        15(8/54)      11(4/35)      help_test.1<br>        61(33/54)     34(12/35)     empty_file_test.1<br>        69(37/54)     40(14/35)     stdin_test.1<br></pre>
<a name="988202">
With respect to block coverage, <em>help_test.1</em> achieved 15
percent coverage, <em>empty_file_test.1</em> adds an additional 46
percent coverage (total of 61%) and <em>stdin_test.1</em> adds another
8 percent coverage (total of 69%). However, these results have been
presented as a cumulative running total. The <em>-q</em> option
implies a per test case summary, so the <em>-p</em> option need not be
explicitly included.
</a>
<p><a name="986224">
<h3>8.4.2 Including Test Cost
</h3>
</a><a name="986288">
The user-assigned cost of executing each test case is included in a
summary using the <em>-K</em> command-line option. For example, the
following generates a summary of the test cases presented above,
including test cost:
</a></p>
<pre><a name="986289">	prompt:&gt; atac -sK main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br></a><br></pre>
The summary report generated looks like this:
<pre><br><br>        cost   % blocks      % decisions   test<br>        ------ ------------- ------------- ------------- <br>        10     15(8/54)      11(4/35)      help_test.1<br>        20     50(27/54)     26(9/35)      empty_file_test.1<br>        20     37(20/54)     17(6/35)      stdin_test.1<br>        50     69(37/54)     40(14/35)     == all ==<br></pre>
<a name="484460">
The <em>-K</em> option implies a per test case summary, so the <em>-p</em>
option need not be explicitly included.
</a>
<p><a name="986273">
<h3>8.4.3 Sorting by Coverage
</h3>
</a><a name="986274">
Test cases are sorted in order of decreasing additional coverage using
the <em>-S</em> command-line option. For example, to sort the test
cases summarized above enter:
</a></p>
<pre><a name="986277">	prompt:&gt; atac -sS main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br></a><br></pre>
The summary report generated looks like this:
<pre><br><br>        % blocks      % decisions   test<br>        ------------- ------------- ------------- <br>        50(27/54)     26(9/35)      empty_file_test.1<br>        15(8/54)      11(4/35)      help_test.1<br>        37(20/54)     17(6/35)      stdin_test.1<br>        69(37/54)     40(14/35)     == all ==<br></pre>
<a name="986283">
These test cases have been listed in order of increasing effectiveness
across all coverage measures. The <em>-S</em> option implies a per
test case summary, so the <em>-p</em> option need not be explicitly
included.

<h3>8.4.4 Sorting by Cumulative Cost per Additional Coverage
</h3>
</a><a name="986293">
Test cases are sorted in order of decreasing cost per additional code
coverage using the <em>-Q</em> command-line option. All costs are
presented as cumulative values. For example, to summarize the sorted
cumulative cost per additional coverage for the test cases executed
above enter:
</a></p>
<pre><a name="986294">	prompt:&gt; atac -sQ main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br></a><br></pre>
The summary report generated looks like this:
<pre><br><br>        cost   % blocks      % decisions   test<br>        (cum)  (cumulative)  (cumulative)    <br>        ------ ------------- ------------- ------------- <br>        20     50(27/54)     26(9/35)      empty_file_test.1<br>        30     61(33/54)     34(12/35)     help_test.1<br>        50     69(37/54)     40(14/35)     stdin_test.1<br></pre>
<a name="992762">
This output is similar to that obtained using the <em>-S</em> option,
however test cost is also considered. The <em>-Q</em> option implies a
per test case summary, so the <em>-p</em> option need not be
explicitly included. Note that using the <em>-Q</em> option is
equivalent to using the option sequence <em>-qKS</em>.

<h2>8.5 Ignoring What is Out-of-Date
</h2>
</a><a name="992767">
By default, the character-based interface issues an error message if
any of a program's <em>.atac</em> files have been significantly
modified since a test case represented in its trace file was executed.
Modifications which change only comments and white space in a program
do not significantly affect the <em>.atac</em> files. Other changes
may affect the structure of a program and these significantly affect
the <em>.atac</em> files. <em>atac</em> determines that a test is out-of-date
by comparing the check sums of source files in test cases and <em>.atac</em>
files, as appropriate (see </a><a href="managing.html#973974">Section
7.7, <em>Dealing with Source Code Modifications</em></a>). The
graphical interface also issues a warning whenever it detects any test
cases to be out-of-date with any source files. It also marks the
out-of-date test cases as an `o' in the test case display.
</p>
<p><a name="992746">
If a <em>.atac</em> file has been modified since the last test case
was executed, you can force the generation of <em>atac </em>summary
reports using the <em>-i</em> command-line option. This will cause <em>atac
</em>to ignore out of date information although warnings may be issued.
In general, the <em>-i</em> option should be used with caution.
However, it can be used to avoid re-running tests against source code
known to be unmodified prior to the last system build. The graphical
interface, however, currently does not provide a way to force such a
display.<br>
