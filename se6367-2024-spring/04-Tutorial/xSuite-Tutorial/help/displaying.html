  ATAC &amp xSuite: Displaying Uncovered Code<br>
  <br></a></h1><a name="221977"></a>

  <p><a name="221982">When a program is compiled with
  <em>atac</em>, an <em>.atac</em> file is generated for each
  instrumented source file, and coverage information is appended to
  a trace file each time the compiled executable is tested. Each
  <em>.atac</em> file contains a list of what should be covered
  when testing its corresponding source file. The trace file
  records what has actually been covered during testing. This
  chapter discusses how to display uncovered source code using
  these files, a capability that helps the tester in developing
  test cases to improve code coverage.</a></p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="221964">9.1 Displaying Uncovered
  Code</a></h2><a name="221962">ATAC offers two user interfaces: a
  character-based interface referred to as <em>atac</em> (for
  historical reasons), and a graphical interface referred to as
  xSuite. The former is invoked using the command, <em>atac</em> 
  , and the
  latter is invoked with the command, <em>xsuite</em>.

  <p><a name="211927">The character-based interface, <em>atac,</em>
  accepts various command-line options that specify various display
  selection choices besides accepting one or more <em>.atac</em>
  and <em>.trace</em> files as input. <em>atac</em> compares what
  should be covered in a given source file to what has been covered
  and outputs its findings in a variety of ways. Unless invoked in
  summary report generation mode (with the <em>-s, -C,</em> or
  <em>-v</em> command-line options; see</a> <a href=
  "generating.html#994147">Chapter 8, <em>ATAC: Generating Summary
  Reports</em></a>), <em>atac</em> outputs the results of its
  analysis in the display mode. Source code fragments are paged
  across the screen and uncovered testable attributes are
  highlighted in reverse video. Additional arguments are used to
  further specify precisely which testable attributes are
  displayed.</p>

  <p><a name="211388">If you are following the tutorial example,
  clear out the <em>.trace</em> file by removing it. Then execute
  the <em>wordcount</em> program against the following four
  tests:</a></p>
  <pre>  prompt:&gt; wordcount -?<br>  prompt:&gt; wordcount -bad_option<br>  prompt:&gt; wordcount no_such_file<br>  prompt:&gt; wordcount empty<br>
</pre><a name="211420">Now all uncovered testable attributes can be
displayed using the character-based interface by entering:</a>
  <pre>
	<a name=
	"213535">  prompt:&gt; atac main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br></a>
	</pre><a name="223115"></a><a name="213560">The beginning part of
	the display generated appears in</a> <a href=
	"displaying.html#213560">Figure 9-1</a>. The first line of the
	display informs the tester that function-entry coverage has been
	completely satisfied. This line is followed by a code fragment
	highlighting the eight remaining uncovered blocks in the file <em>
	  main.c</em> followed by some of the remaining uncovered blocks in
	  the file <em>wc.c</em> (recall that a function call ends a
	  block). Additional information follows in the display, but the
	  output appears one page at-a-time, so the tester can study it
	  while developing test cases.

  <!--==============================================-->
  <a name="214020">The source window in the middle displays the
  source file that corresponds to the first <em>.atac</em> file on
  the command line. All covered and uncovered blocks in the file
  are highlighted in various colors. Each color represents a
  certain weight. If, for instance, a block has a weight, 9, it
  means any test that causes that block to be covered is guaranteed
  to cover a <em>minimum</em> of 9 other blocks or decisions as
  well. xSuite determines these
  weights by doing a detailed control flow analysis of the program.
  White represents zero weight and red represents the highest
  weight among all blocks in the file. Thus, if a block is
  highlighted in white, it means that it has already been covered
  by a test case and covering it again will not add new coverage.
  If, on the other extreme, a block is highlighted in red, it means
  that it has not been covered by any test case so far and covering
  it first is the most efficient way to add new coverage to the
  program; it is the best way to add maximum coverage in a single
  program execution.</a>

  <p><a name="214878">The color spectrum chart above the source
  window displays the actual weights associated with each color.
  The annotated scroll bar to the left of the source window
  displays a thumbnail sketch of the entire file. It is very useful
  in quickly locating where the red blocks, or the "hot spots," in
  the file are. Clicking with the left mouse button at any spot in
  the scroll bar brings the corresponding region of the file into
  the source window. The arrows at the top and the bottom of the
  scroll bar may be used to scroll up or down the source file a few
  lines at a time. Alternatively, the mouse may be dragged up or
  down the scroll bar with the left mouse button pressed to rapidly
  scroll through the file.</a></p>

  <p><a name="214882">Test cases may be run in parallel to a
  xSuite session. Running a test
  case causes new coverage information to be logged to a
  <em>.trace</em> file. xSuite
  continuously monitors the specified trace files to see if any new
  coverage information has been added to any of them. If so, it
  highlights the "<em>Update</em>" button in the top button bar to
  alert the tester to this fact. The tester may then choose to
  click on this button to incorporate the new coverage information
  in the display, or wait to do so until several other test cases
  have been run.</a></p>

  <h2><a name="214849">9.2 Selecting What to
  Display</a></h2><a name="214803">It is possible to select the
  uncovered testable attributes to be displayed. In the character-
  based interface, selections are made by controlling the
  <em>.atac</em> files submitted on the argument list and using
  various command-line options (the options discussed within this
  section may be used together freely). In the graphical user
  interface, xSuite, as mentioned
  earlier, selections are made by selecting appropriate menus and
  the relevant entries with the help of the mouse.</a>

  <h3><a name="214756">9.2.1 By File</a></h3><a name=
  "220702"><em>The</em> character-based <em>interface</em> only
  displays the uncovered testable attributes for those
  <em>.atac</em> files that are submitted on the argument list. For
  example, the display generated in</a> <a href=
  "displaying.html#213560">Figure 9-1</a> may be limited to only
  one file, <em>main.c,</em> by entering:
  <pre>
	<a name=
	"211455">  prompt:&gt; atac main.atac wordcount.trace <br></a>
	</pre>
	
	
	<a name="223546">The graphical interface, on the other hand,
	always displays one source file at a time even when multiple	source files make up the code that is being tested. 
	<!-- superseded by *.atacp file By default
	it displays the source file that corresponds to the first
	<em>.atac</em> file on the command line, as mentioned earlier. -->
	
	A different source file may be displayed by double clicking on the desired file
	in the "<em>Summary</em>" pane (located in the lower left of the interface). 
	If the summary pane is <em>not</em> displaying 
	a list of files then the "<em>by-file</em>" option may be selected by
	choosing it from the rightmost drop down in the summary pane.
	For all the source files combined into the *.atacp file, 
	<em>xSuite</em> lists the corresponding source file in
	this window. This list can be sorted in different ways. 
	Any of the columns in the  "<em>Summary</em>" window can be used to sort the 
	display. Clicking on a column header will result in sorting the display
	by that column. Clicking again on the same column will sort the display in
	the opposite order. For example, clicking on the "<em>File</em>" column header
	will sort files by name in alpha-numeric
	order. Clicking on the same column header again will sort the files
	in reverse alpha-numeric order. </a>

  <h3><a name="223850">9.2.2 By Function</a></h3><a name=
  "211457">In the character-based interface, display may be limited
  to uncovered testable attributes within a selected set of
  functions using the <em>-F</em> command-line option. For example,
  the display generated in</a> <a href=
  "displaying.html#213560">Figure 9-1</a> may be limited to the
  functions <em>main</em> and <em>count</em> by entering:
  <pre>
	<a name= "211458">  prompt:&gt; atac -F main -F count main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br></a>
</pre><a name="211454">	Note that multiple functions may be
specified by repeating the <em>-F</em> option and these functions
must be defined within the <em>.atac</em> files listed on the
command-line. Functions may be named using wild card characters.
These wild cards are the same as those used by the UNIX-like
command processor in naming files <em>(*, ?, [...])</em>. In some
cases, quote marks may be needed to prevent the command processor
from expanding the function names containing wild cards as file
names.</a>

  <p><a name="223292">The graphical interface, as mentioned
  earlier, always displays an entire source file in the source
  window that the user can browse through using the scroll bar.
  Therefore there is no direct way of limiting the source display
  to certain functions in the graphical interface. Selecting the
  "<em>By-Function</em>" option from the rightmost drop down
  in the "<em>Summary</em>" window pane
  and then doubling clicking on a particular function name, say,
  <em>main.c:main</em>, makes function <em>main</em> in
  <em>main.c</em> appear in the source window. However, this does
  not prevent another function, <em>print</em> in our case, in
  <em>main.c (i.e., main.c:print)</em> from being displayed in the
  source window even though it may be hidden due to the size of the
  source window. Nevertheless, you can still view the function
  <em>print</em> by browsing through using the scroll bar.</a></p>

  <p><a name="223857">Functions listed in the "<em>Summary</em>"
  pane can be sorted in different ways. Similar to the sorting of
  file names by the various columns one can click on the column
  headers and sort the display by that column. For example,  
  clicking on the "<em>Covered</em>" will sort functions by the 
  "<em>Block Coverage</em>" (if that is the metric selected) in
  ascending order.</a></p>

  <h3><a name="216685">9.2.3 By Coverage Criteria</a></h3>
  
  <a name= "211461">In the character-based interface, display may be limited
  to uncovered attributes for a selected set of coverage measure(s)
  using the <em>-m {bcdeu}</em> command-line option. The argument
  to <em>-m</em> selects one or more coverage measures: <em>e</em>
  selects function-entry coverage, <em>b</em> block coverage and
  <em>d</em> decision coverage (see</a> <a href=
  "overview.html#623861">Section 3.3, <em>What Does ATAC
  Do?</em></a>, for an explanation of these measures). For example,
  the display generated in <a href="displaying.html#213560">Figure
  9-1</a> may be limited to decision coverage in <em>main.c</em>
  and <em>wc.c</em> by entering:

	<a name="214587"></a><a name="223132">In <em>xSuite</em>, the desired coverage type may be

  <h3><a name="211391">9.2.4 By Test Case</a></h3><a name=
  "211422">By default, <em>atac</em> displays uncovered testable
  attributes after reconciling all test case trace information
  recorded in a given trace file against all <em>.atac</em> files
  submitted on the command- line. You can display what has not been
  covered with respect to selected test cases in the
  character-based interface by using the <em>-n test_name</em>
  command-line option. For example, assume the four tests presented
  at the beginning of this chapter have been executed against the
  <em>wordcount</em> program. Any testable attributes not covered
  by the first two of these tests are displayed by entering:</a>
  <pre>
        prompt:&gt; atac -n wordcount.1 -n wordcount.2 main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br>
	</pre>

	<a name="220778">Notice that multiple <em>-n</em> arguments
	may be submitted on a single command-line. In such a case, the
	union of all the tests named is selected. Tests can also be named
	using wild card characters. These wild cards are the same as those
	used by the UNIX-like command processor in naming files <em>(*, ?,
	[...])</em>. So, entering:</a>
  <pre>
        prompt:&gt; atac -n 'wordcount.[1-2]' main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br>
	</pre>

	<a name="211440">results in the same listing as the previous
	example. In some cases, quote marks may be needed to prevent the
	command processor from expanding the test names as file names.</a>

  <p><a name="211441">Sometimes it is necessary to select all tests
  other than those that have been named. The <em>-x</em> option is
  used to select the complement of all tests specified using one or
  more instances of the<em>-n</em> option. For example,
  entering:</a></p>
  <pre>
        prompt:&gt; atac -x -n 'wordcount.[1-2]' main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br>
	</pre>

  <h3><a name="224067">9.2.5 All Uncovered Testable
  Attributes</a></h3><a name="224068">By default, after performing
  the required analysis, the character-based interface only
  displays those uncovered testable attributes that are covered by
  a weaker measure (see</a> <a href="overview.html#623861">Section
  3.3, <em>What Does ATAC Do?</em></a>, for a discussion concerning
  the relative strength of coverage measures). For instance,
  suppose the <em>wordcount</em> program contains an uncovered
  block that is also part of an uncovered decision. Only the
  uncovered block will be displayed by <em>atac</em>, and the
  uncovered decision will be omitted from its output (because it is
  a stronger coverage measure). This is to avoid repeatedly
  displaying multiple uncovered testable attributes, each involving
  the same source code constructs.

  <p><a name="211445">You can force the display of all uncovered
  testable attributes, whether they are covered by a weaker measure
  or not, using the <em>-a</em> command-line option. For example,
  assume the four tests presented at the beginning of this chapter
  have been executed against the <em>wordcount</em> program. Enter
  the following to force the display of all uncovered testable
  attributes:</a></p>
  <pre>
	<a name= "211447">  prompt:&gt; atac -a main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace<br></a>
	</pre>

	<a name="216921">The graphical interface, on the other hand,
	always displays all uncovered testable attributes whether or not
	the corresponding weaker measures are covered. This is because,
	unlike the character-based interface, <em>xSuite</em> displays 
	all covered and uncovered attributes "in
  	place" in the source file and ignoring uncovered attributes not
  	covered by a weaker measure will not reduce the size of the
  	output the user has to scroll through.</a>

  <h2><a name="211427">9.3 Ignoring What is
  Out-of-Date</a></h2><a name="223979">By default, the
  character-based interface issues an error message if any of a
  program's <em>.atac</em> files have been significantly modified
  since a test case represented in its trace file was executed.
  See</a> <a href="generating.html#992773">Chapter 8.5,
  <em>Ignoring What is Out-of-Date</em></a> for more information
  about how ATAC handles these situations.

  <h2><a name="223984">9.4 Using Underscoring Rather Than
  Highlighting</a></h2><a name="223985">The source code fragments
  output by the character-based interface are larger than the
  uncovered testable attributes being displayed. This is to provide
  the tester with sufficient context to identify and understand
  what needs to be covered within the program itself. Within these
  source code fragments, <em>atac</em>, by default, identifies the
  testable attributes of interest by highlighting them. This
  approach is convenient for display purposes, but the output may
  not be easy to print without capturing screen images.</a>

  <p><a name="211444">You can cause the character-based interface
  to use underscoring, rather than highlighting, using the
  <em>-u</em> command-line option. For example, a display similar
  to that in</a> <a href="displaying.html#213560">Figure 9-1</a>,
  except using underscoring, is generated by entering:</p>
  <pre>
<a name=
"211431">  prompt:&gt; atac -u main.atac wc.atac wordcount.trace &gt; myfile<br></a>
</pre><a name="211343">and then viewing the contents of
<em>myfile</em>. The output may also be sent directly to a printer,
allowing easy generation of hard copy coverage displays.<br>

  <h2><a name="211343">9.5 Marking Defensive Code</a></h2>

  <h2><a name="211343"></a></h2><a name="211343"><br>
  In a program there is often code that is not normally intended to
  be executed because it handles unexpected error conditions or it
  implements unsupported features or debugging options, etc. By
  default, ATAC includes this code in coverage displays. If the
  programmer does not intend to test this code, coverage displays
  that include this code may be distracting and, possibly,
  misleading.<br>
  <br>
  The programmer may mark this code as defensive in the graphical
  interface. There are three objects that can be marked as
  defensive code:<br></a>

  <ul>
    <li><a name="211343">A block of code</a></li>

  To mark a block of code as defensive, "<em>Ctrl + LeftClick</em>"
  on the block. The block will change its color to gray. If there
  are other blocks or decisions that would be always covered if the
  selected block is covered, they are marked defensive as well.
  "<em>Ctrl + LeftClick</em>" on the block again will remove the
  marking. When the state of the marking is changed, the
  "SaveMarkedBlocks" menu entry will highlight. Click on it to save
  the changes. To discard all marking changes since&nbsp; last
  save, return to the summary screen by clicking on the "Summary"
  menu entry. You will be asked whether to discard changes.<br>
  <br>
  To mark a decision as defensive, switch to decision coverage.
  Click on the decision of interest, and "<em>Ctrl +
  LeftClick</em>" on the branch that should be marked as defensive.
  As with the blocks, all blocks and decisions that would always be
  executed together are marked as well (see</a> <a href=
  "displaying.html#defcode-fig1">Figure 9-6</a>).<br>

  To mark a function as defensive, mark the first block of the
  function. All blocks and decisions in this function will be
  marked defensive as well.<br>
  <br>
  To optimize performance, the weights of blocks are not
  recalculated every time a block/decision is marked. Thus there
  are two inconsistencies that may be observed after the
  block/decision is marked or unmarked but not yet saved:<br>
  <br></a>

  <ul>
    <li><a name="211343">The item that is being marked has the
    highest score (red color), and it is the only item of highest
    score. In such case, there will be no block of red color in the
    file, even though the color bar on the top suggests
    otherwise.</a></li>

    <li><a name="211343">The item is being unmarked and it was
    saved as marked before. In such case the weight of the marked
    item is zero, and it will appear as covered (white) until the
    save button is clicked.</a></li>
  </ul>
