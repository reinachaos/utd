  <h2><a name="203898">5.1 Instrumenting on Linux</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="203798">5.1.1 Basic Instrumentation</a></h3><a name=
  "206197">To compile with ATAC, remove all previously created
  object files and executable files you intend to build. Then
  compile the software as you normally would, but prefix the
  compile command with <em>atac</em>. For example, to compile an
  executable called <em>wordcount</em> from two source files
  <em>wc.c</em> and <em>main.c</em>, enter the following:</a>
  <pre>
<a name="203800">  prompt:&gt; atac cc -o wordcount wc.c main.c<br></a>
</pre><a name="203801">In addition to creating the executable
program <em>wordcount</em> and the object files <em>wc.o</em> and
<em>main.o</em>, ATAC has created the files <em>wc.atac</em> and
<em>main.atac</em>. ATAC creates a <em>.atac</em> file for each
<em>.c</em> file it compiles. These files contain static coverage
information used in test analysis. It is possible to restrict
instrumentation and the collection of coverage information to
selected source files (see</a> <a href="instrumenting.html#203817">
  Section 5.1.3, <em>Selectively Instrumenting Software</em></a>).

  <h3><a name="203808">5.1.2 Integrating with
  Makefiles</a></h3><a name="203809">If your existing Makefiles
  make use of the CC macro, it is easy to integrate the use of ATAC
  with <em>make</em>. When invoking <em>make</em> to build a
  target, simply redefine CC to be ATAC, as follows:</a>
  <pre>
<a name="203811">  prompt:&gt; make CC="atac cc"<br></a>
</pre><a name="203813">In the case of the <em>wordcount</em>
program, the output for a typical <em>Makefile</em> might look like
this:</a>
  <pre>  atac cc -c wc.c<br>  atac cc -c main.c<br>  atac cc -o wordcount wc.o main.o<br>
</pre>

  <h3><a name="203817">5.1.3 Selectively Instrumenting
  Software</a></h3><a name="203818">If you only need coverage
  measures for a portion of your software contained in selected
  source files, it is unnecessary to compile the remaining source
  files with ATAC. Because compilation with ATAC increases
  execution time, memory use, and object code size, (see</a>
  <a href="overview.html#623840">Section 3.5, <em>What Will Using
  ATAC Cost You?</em></a>) it may be advantageous to use ATAC only
  on source files for which coverage measures are required.

  <p><a name="203822">You can limit coverage analysis of your
  software by selectively instrumenting specific source files. Only
  those source files that have been compiled with ATAC are
  instrumented, and only instrumented portions of the software
  collect trace information during test execution. This is
  accomplished through separate compilation, which ATAC supports in
  the same manner as <em>cc</em>. Simply compile all source files
  to be instrumented with <em>atac cc</em> and all remaining source
  files with the standard C compiler, then link the object files.
  Linking must be performed by <em>atac cc</em> so that the proper
  run-time library is included in the executable. For example, we
  can manually instrument <em>wc.c</em> and leave <em>main.c</em>
  untouched by entering:</a></p>
  <pre>  prompt:&gt; rm *.o wordcount<br>  prompt:&gt; atac cc -c wc.c<br>  prompt:&gt; cc -c main.c<br>  prompt:&gt; atac cc -o wordcount wc.o main.o<br>
</pre><a name="203824">Alternatively, we can accomplish the same
thing using the existing Makefile by doing the following:</a>
  <pre>  prompt:&gt; make clean<br>  prompt:&gt; make main.o<br>  prompt:&gt; make CC="atac cc"<br></pre>
  
  <a name="205521">Note that it is not possible to selectively
	instrument functions within a given source file.</a>

  <p><a name="203827">At times you may lose track of which object
  files or executable files were compiled with ATAC. The
  <em>atacid</em> command may be used to identify files compiled
  with ATAC. For example, do the following for the
  <em>wordcount</em> program:</a></p>
  <pre><a name="203828">  prompt:&gt; atacid wc.o main.o wordcount | fgrep ATAC<br></a></pre>
  
  <a name="203831">If none of the files were compiled with
	ATAC, no lines are printed.</a>

  <h3><a name="203858">5.1.4 Linking with ld</a></h3><a name=
  "206225">The <em>atac cc</em> command invokes <em>ld</em>, the
  standard Linux linker, to link the object modules comprising an
  executable. If desired, you may explicitly invoke <em>atac
  ld</em> to customize this linking step. In this way, object files
  created with <em>atac cc</em> may be linked with object files and
  libraries created by other means.</a>

  <p><a name="204159">The command line options for <em>atac</em>
  <em>ld</em> are the same as for <em>ld</em>. A program linked in
  this way outputs trace information to the file
  <em>a.out.trace</em>, where <em>a.out</em> is the name of the
  executable file created by <em>atac ld</em>. If the <em>-o
  prog</em> option is used to explicitly name the resulting
  executable, then the trace file generated is named
  <em>prog.trace</em>. To compile ATAC-specific object files prior
  to its link stage, <em>atac ld</em> invokes <em>cc</em>. After
  this ATAC-specific preprocessing has been completed, <em>atac
  ld</em> then invokes <em>ld</em> to link all object files. The
  use of another C compiler may be substituted for the <em>cc</em>
  command, and the use of another linker may be substituted for
  <em>ld</em>.</a></p>

  <p><a name="203868">The following commands compile <em>wc.c</em>
  using <em>atac cc</em> and <em>main.c</em> using <em>cc</em>. The
  resulting object files are then linked to build
  <em>wordcount</em>:</a></p>
  <pre>  prompt:&gt; atac cc -c wc.c<br>  prompt:&gt; cc -c main.c<br>  prompt:&gt; atac ld -o wordcount /usr/lib/crt0.o wc.o main.o -lc<br></pre>

	<a name="204969">It is also possible to generate an ATAC
	instrumented executable without using a compiler to do the
	linking.</a>

  <p><a name="203873">This is most easily understood via an
  example. Let us use the same wordcount program as used before for
  the example. To begin, create a directory, <em>cd</em> to it and
  copy the contents of the directory in which the tutorial files
  are installed into the new directory. There should be two c
  files: <em>main.c</em> and <em>wc.c</em>, and a Makefile. You can
  compile the wordcount program with <em>atac</em> by
  entering:</a></p>
  
  <pre><a name="205186">  prompt:&gt; make CC="atac cc"<br></a></pre>

	<a name="203875">This is the same as:</a>
  <pre>  prompt:&gt; atac cc  -g  -c  wc.c<br>  prompt:&gt; atac cc  -g  -c  main.c<br>  prompt:&gt; atac cc  -g  -o  wordcount wc.o main.o<br></pre>

	<a name="205370">However, you are not required to use
	<em>cc</em> to make the link. Instead of running the third command
	above, you can use a link editor such as <em>ld</em> to generate
	the executable. To do so, you must first run:</a>
	
  <pre><a name="206067">  prompt:&gt; atac_env_create<br></a></pre>
  
	  <a name="206346">to create an atac environment file
	(<em>atac_env.o</em>) in the same directory where
	<em>atac_env_create</em> is invoked. Then you need to provide the
	standard C library (<em>-lc</em>), or any customized C libraries
	which are essential for your programs. Note that the exact order of
	these supporting libraries may vary depending on your environment.
	In addition, you need to supply the ATAC run time routine
	(<em>atac_rt.o</em>) in order for the executable to be able to
	collect the execution trace. Given all these, the command you
	should use looks like:</a>
  
  <pre>  prompt:&gt; ld -o wordcount wc.o main.o `ataclib`/atac_rt.o <br>  atac_env.o /usr/lib/crt0.o -lc<br></pre>
  
	  <a name="206053">After a test execution, the trace
	information is saved in <em>a.out.trace</em> instead of
	<em>wordcount.trace</em> unless ATAC_TRACE is set otherwise.</a>

  <h3><a name="206397">5.1.5 Suppressing Instrumentation of Include
  Files</a></h3><a name="206400">In C and C++ programs, source
  files included with the <em>#include</em> directive may contain
  executable code. By default, ATAC instruments executable code in
  include files unless the include file came from a system header
  file. Include files that have been instrumented with ATAC will
  appear in the coverage summary by source file display.</a>

  <p><a name="206422">A system header file is defined as a file
  that was included from one of the system include directories. The
  list of directories that contain system header files appears
  in:</a></p>
  <pre>  `ataclib`/atac/edg/lib/g++_incl_paths</pre>
  
  This list is applicable for both C and C++ programs.

  <p><a name="206422">Include files that have been instrumented
  with ATAC will appear in the coverage summary by source file
  display. Suppressing instrumentation of selected <em>include
  files</em> may be desirable either to improve run-time
  performance or to remove those files from the coverage summary by
  source file. To modify the definition of a system file, edit the
  file <em>`ataclib`/atac/edg/lib/g++_incl_paths</em>. The file
  contains a ':' separated list of paths. Append the directory that
  contains include files that should be effectively treated as
  system files and not instrumented.</a></p>

  <p><a name="206511">Note: The include path search order
  is:</a></p>

  <ol>
    <li>System include directories (from
    <em>`ataclib`/atac/edg/lib/g++_incl_paths</em>)</li>

    <li>User-specified directories (<em>cc -I
    "some_directory"</em>)</li>
  </ol>This is important in the case of include files with the same
  names in different locations. For example, assume we have
  different files <em>"/inc1/a.h"</em> and <em>"/inc2/a.h"</em>.
  The command <em>"cc -I/inc1/ -I/inc2/ main.c"</em> will produce
  different result from <em>"cc -I/inc2/ -I/inc1/ main.c"</em>.<br>
  If the <em>"/inc2/"</em> path is moved to the g++_incl_paths
  file, it will be searched before <em>"/inc1/"</em> path, and thus
  produce different result from <em>"cc -I/inc1/ -I/inc2/
  main.c"</em>.

  preprocessor macro expansion, ATAC display components highlight
  the macro name and arguments within the original source code.
  Normally, blocks other than the first block inside a macro
  expansion are not counted or displayed. It is assumed that the
  tester does not expect complete coverage of each macro at each
  invocation. 
  <!-- These blocks may be counted using the <em>atac -J</em> option. --></a>

  <h2><a name="206311">5.4 Compilation and Link Errors</a></h2>When
  a program fails to compile or link with ATAC, check that it
  compiles and links without errors using your installed compiler
  (Refer to <a href="appendixB.html#1001045">Appendix A,
  <em>Platform Specific Information</em></a> for the specific
  commands to execute.) If the same command line arguments are
  used, a program that compiles and links without errors using a
  standard compiler should compile and link without errors under
  ATAC, with the following exception:

  <ul>
 
    <li>
      <a name="196225">The Microsoft compiler allows some template
      structures that are syntactically incorrect. For example:</a>
      <pre><a name="196225">template&lt;class T&gt;<br> class A {<br>  public:<br>    A() {<br>     not_yet_defined_function();<br>    }<br>  };<br><br> int not_yet_defined_function() {<br>  return 0;<br> }<br><br>void main() { A&lt;int&gt; a; };<br>    </a></pre>

	<a name="196225">The Microsoft compiler will successfully
	compile the sample even though the function is used before it is
	declared. ATAC will not parse such a template successfully.</a>
    </li>
    
  </ul><a name="196236">When ATAC has trouble parsing a program, it
  will issue a <em>parse failed</em> message and fail to compile
  the program.</a>

  <p><a name="196115">After preprocessing and data-flow
  instrumentation of a source program, ATAC passes the modified
  program to the standard C or C++ compiler. Errors from the
  standard compiler may indicate an error in ATAC (e.g., during
  instrumentation) or in the standard compiler.</a></p>

  <p><a name="196203">A program compiled with ATAC must be linked
  with ATAC. If linked with the standard compiler, the linker will
  issue a message indicating an undefined external symbol named

  library has not been included in the executable.</a></p>
