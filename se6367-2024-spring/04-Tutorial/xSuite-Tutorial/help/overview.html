<p>
	<a name="623820">This chapter provides an overview of the
	Toolsuite's code coverage tools (<em>atac</em>) and is
	recommended reading for first-time users or those who want a
	summary of the code coverage features.</a>
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="623823">3.1 What is ATAC?</a></h2>

<p>
	<a name="623864"><em>atac</em> is a <em>coverage analysis</em> tool that
	aids in testing programs written in the C or C++ programming
	language. <em>atac</em> measures how thoroughly a program has
	been exercised by a set of tests, identifies code within the
	program that is not well tested, and determines the overlap among
	individual test cases. <em>atac</em> is used by software
	developers and testers to measure the <em>adequacy</em> of a test
	set and identify areas in a program that require further testing.
	These measures may be used for project tracking to indicate
	progress during testing, and as acceptance criteria to subsequent
	stages of development and testing. Regression testers also may
	use <em>atac</em> to identify a particular subset of a test set
	that achieves high coverage at limited cost.</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="623838">3.2 What is Coverage Testing?</a></h2>

<p>
	<a name="623870">Coverage testing suggests a
	number of criteria that should be satisfied when testing a
	program. Examples of such criteria are:</a>
	<ul>		<li><a name="623871">All statements should be executed;</a></li>
		<li><a name="623916">All decisions should be evaluated both to
								true and to false.</a></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	<a name="623932">The goal of coverage testing is to develop
	a set of tests that satisfy the criteria. Notice that each of
	these example criteria are dependent upon a program's source
	code. Testing methods that use information about a program's
	internal structure are said to perform <em>white-box</em>
	testing. Methods that only consider a program's inputs and
	outputs, making no use of its source code, are said to perform
	<em>black-box</em> testing. <em>atac</em> supports white-box
	testing, so the <em>coverage criteria</em> discussed here will be
	tied to the source code of the program under test.</a>
</p>

<p>
	<a name="623931">Each specific coverage criterion identifies a
	number of program constructs to be exercised <em>(covered)</em>
	by a set of tests. The constructs to be covered are called
	<em>testable attributes</em>. For instance, in covering all
	decisions as suggested above, there is one testable attribute for
	each true branch and one for each false branch in the program. A
	tester covers them by developing a test set that executes each of
	these branches. A test set is considered <em>adequate</em> with
	respect to a given coverage criterion if all testable attributes
	identified by the criterion are exercised, at least once, by some
	test within the set.</a>
</p>

<p>
	<a name="623920">It is harder to develop an adequate test set
	for some coverage criteria than for others. Weaker criteria
	usually require fewer test cases than stronger criteria to obtain
	completely adequate coverage. However, a test set adequate for a
	weaker criterion is less likely to reveal an error than a test
	set adequate for a stronger criterion. For example, it generally
	requires fewer test cases to ensure that all functions within a
	program are invoked than to ensure that all statements are
	executed. However, a test set that executes all program
	statements tends to test a program more thoroughly than a test
	set that invokes all functions. This is because it is possible to
	invoke all functions without executing all of their statements.
	The converse is not true.</a>
</p>

<p>
	<a name="623839">One coverage criterion is stronger than
	another if, for any program, completely adequate coverage for the
	first implies completely adequate coverage for the second and, as
	with statement and function coverage, the converse is not true.
	If the converse is also true, then the coverage criteria are of
	equal strength.</a>
</p>

<p>
	<a name="623917">In practice, for many coverage criteria, a
	completely adequate test set is not easy to create for most
	programs. As a test set is being developed, it exhibits a level
	of adequacy called a <em>coverage measure</em> - the percentage
	of testable attributes exercised by its set of tests. As a test
	set's coverage measure improves, it becomes harder to create test
	cases that cover the remaining, uncovered testable attributes. In
	some cases, it may be impossible or impractical to achieve
	completely adequate coverage. For example, a program may contain
	code to detect and handle error conditions that are very hard to
	simulate during testing. The appropriate target coverage measures
	for any program under test depend on the characteristics and
	reliability requirements of that program.</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="623861">3.3 What Does ATAC Do?</a></h2>

<p>
	<a name="630563"></a><a name="62991"></a>
	<em>atac</em> provides an integrated suite of
	software tools that support coverage testing for two coverage
	criteria (as described later): <em>block and decision</em>. It
	should be noted that&nbsp; <em>function-call</em> and
	<em>function-return</em> are not currently available in <em>xSuite</em>, the graphical
	interface.&nbsp;Given a program to test, <em>atac</em> computes
	its set of testable attributes and instruments it to record trace
	information during test execution. As subsequent tests are
	executed, the trace information is appended to a trace file. At
	any point, a tester can selectively report coverage measures or
	display source code associated with any uncovered testable
	attributes. The former allows the tester to assess how the test
	is progressing, the latter aids in developing new tests to
	exercise what has not been covered.
</p>

<p>
	<a name="629299"><em>atac</em> can instrument all, or a
	subset, of the files making up a software system. This allows
	testing to be targeted at a specific portion of the system and
	makes it possible to incrementally manage the overhead of testing
	a large system. The coverage measures reported only pertain to
	that source code which has been instrumented, and any
	instrumentation added has no effect on non-instrumented
	code.</a>
</p>

<h3><a name="629322">3.3.1 Function-Entry and Block Coverage</a></h3>

<p>
	<a name="623865">The weakest coverage criteria
	measured by <em>atac</em> is <em>function-entry</em>.
	<em>Function-entry</em> coverage ensures that all functions
	within a program are called at least once.&nbsp;</a>
</p>

<p>
	<a name="628387"><em>Block</em> coverage ensures that all
	<em>basic blocks</em> are executed at least once. A <em>basic
	block</em> is a sequence of instructions that, except for the
	last instruction, is free of branches and function calls. So, the
	instructions in any <em>basic block</em> are either executed all
	together, or not at all. In C and C++, a <em>block</em> may
	contain more than one statement if no branching occurs between
	statements; a statement may contain multiple blocks if branching
	occurs inside the statement; an expression may contain multiple
	blocks if branching is implied within the expression (e.g.,
	<em>conditional</em>, <em>logical-and</em>, and <em>logical-or
	expressions</em>). <em>atac</em> begins a new <em>basic
	block</em> after a function call because it is possible that the
	function call will not return (e.g. if exit is called within the
	function).&nbsp;</a>

<p><a name="628437"></a> 
	<a href="overview.html#62908">Figure 3-2</a> 
	presents an example of three
	distinct <em>blocks</em>, as they are displayed in
	<em>atac</em>'s character-based interface. Block 1 consists of a
	logical-expression embedded within a compound
	conditional-expression; Block 2 consists of an entire conditional
	expression; Block 3 consists of the entire body of an
	if-statement. If <em>block</em> coverage is ever less than 100%,
	then there are program statements that have not been executed by
	any test. So, achieving completely adequate <em>block</em>
	coverage ensures that the entire program is at least executed.
	Completely adequate <em>block</em> coverage implies completely
	adequate <em>function-entry</em> coverage.
</p>


<h3><a name="628438">3.3.2 Decision Coverage</a></h3>

<a name="63014"></a>
<div class="figure">

	<div>Figure 3-3 An example of <em>true</em> and
			  <em>false</em> decision paths (character-based display)</div>
</div>

<p>
	<a name="628439"></a>
	<em>Decision</em> coverage
	ensures that each of the branches within a conditional statement
	evaluate to both true and false, at least once. A conditional
	statement may contain a number of conditional expressions, each
	having a true and false decision path passing through it. Each of
	these decision paths corresponds to a different testable
	attribute to be covered. For example, <a href=
	"overview.html#63014">Figure 3-3</a> presents two distinct
	uncovered decisions occurring in the same expression, as they are
	displayed by <em>atac</em>. The first is covered by developing a
	test case that causes <em>c ==</em> ' ' to evaluate true, the
	second by developing a test case causing this expression to
	evaluate false.
</p>

<p>
	<a name="623926">If a decision is not covered during
	testing, then an error might not be revealed in the conditional
	statement containing the decision. Completely adequate
	<em>decision</em> coverage implies completely adequate
	<em>block</em> coverage, except for programs with no branches
	(because there are no decisions to cover).</a>
</p>

<h3><a name="623904">3.4 How Does ATAC Work?</a></h3>

<p>
	<a name="623924">Using <em>atac</em> focuses on
	three main activities: instrumenting the software to be tested,
	executing software tests, and determining how well the software
	has been tested. Instrumentation of the software occurs at
	compile-time, and <em>atac</em> allows large systems to be
	instrumented a-piece-at-a-time. Once instrumentation is complete
	and an executable has been built, a tester executes tests and
	uses <em>atac</em> to generate reports or display uncovered
	source code. The reports reveal the current coverage measures for
	each criteria, indicating how adequate the existing test set is
	and providing a high-level view of progress during testing. The
	tester can also display precisely what needs to be covered and
	develop new tests to improve the current level of code
	coverage.</a>
</p>

<p>
	<a name="623925"><em>atac</em> consists of the following
	tools: the <em>atac</em> compiler <em>(</em>atac cc on Linux,
	<em><em>atac</em>CL</em> on Windows<em>), <em>atac</em>,
	<em>atac</em>tm</em>, and <em>x</em>atac. These are the
	user-layer components of <em>atac</em> invoked by a tester from
	the command line. In addition, there are other executables and a
	run-time library required by <em>atac</em> that are not of
	general interest to users. An executable called
	<em><em>atac</em>lib</em> (Linux) <em>or <em>atac</em>_lib</em>
	(Windows)is invoked by all other <em>atac</em> components when
	they need to locate the <em>atac</em> library. This helps
	minimize the need for users to modify their personal computing
	environment in order to use <em>atac</em>.</a>

</div>

<p>
	<a name="623918"></a><a href=
	"overview.html#62681">Figure 3-6</a> depicts the key inputs and
	outputs during software instrumentation, test execution, and
	coverage analysis. Instrumentation of the software to be tested
	is performed by the <em>atac</em> compiler. The <em>atac</em>
	compiler replaces the standard compiler, while accepting all the
	same command line options. The <em>atac</em> compiler supports
	separate compilation and can be easily used in conjunction with
	the <em>make</em> or <em>nmake</em> programs. The <em>atac</em>
	compiler accepts one or more <em>.c</em> source files as input
	and, for each, computes its testable attributes and instruments
	it to record an execution trace at run-time. The outputs of the
	<em>atac</em> compiler are a <em>.</em>atac file corresponding to
	each <em>.c</em> file and an executable program, <em>a.out.</em>
	All instrumentation is emitted as source code embedded within the
	software to be tested, and then the standard compiler is invoked
	to generate <em>a.out</em> (an alternative compiler may be
	invoked if so desired)<em>.</em> Each <em>.</em>atac file acts as
	a list of all testable attributes that exist within its
	corresponding <em>.c</em> file.
</p>

<p>
	<a name="628483">Each time <em>a.out</em> is executed,
	trace information is appended to a corresponding trace file,
	<em>a.out.trace.</em> This occurs automatically due to the
	instrumentation generated by the <em>atac</em> compiler<em>.</em>
	A tester uses the <em><em>atac</em></em> or <em>x</em>atac tool
	to obtain a high-level measure of test adequacy, or to view
	actual source code that still needs to be covered. The trace file
	and a list of relevant <em>.</em>atac files are inputs to
	<em><em>atac</em></em> and <em>x</em>atac. <em>atac</em>
	reconciles the information contained in <em>a.out.trace</em>
	against all the testable attributes to be covered, as recorded in
	the <em>.</em>atac files. Once what has and has not been covered
	is determined, the results are output in report or display mode,
	as appropriate.</a>
</p>
	
<p>
	<a name="628486">The <em><em>atac</em>tm</em> tool manipulates
	the contents of a trace file. Trace files contain coverage
	information for each test that has been executed. Using
	<em><em>atac</em>tm</em>, a tester can list, rename, extract,
	delete, or assign cost to individual tests. <em>atac</em> permits
	the coverage achieved by arbitrary subsets of tests to be
	compared and computes minimal size and cost subsets of tests
	achieving the same coverage as the entire test set. A tester may
	use these tools to manage a test set during testing and later
	compact it without reducing coverage. This approach reduces the
	cost of any regression testing to be performed in the
	future.</a>
</p>

<p>
	<a name="630806">Although <em>atac</em> provides a large
	number of options for varying the form and content of the
	information reported, defaults have been chosen so that few
	options are required to use the basic features. Complete details
	of the <em>atac</em> commands and options appear later in this
	guide.</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="623840">3.5 What Will Using ATAC Cost You?</a></h2>

<p>
	<a name="630673">Programs compiled with
	<em>atac</em> will execute more slowly and use more memory than
	they normally do. The effect on execution time varies among
	programs depending upon the nature of the computation and the
	size of the trace file. <em>Compute-bound</em> processes are more
	severely effected than <em>I/O-bound</em> processes. Performance
	degradation can range from less than one, to several times the
	normal execution time. Most programs do not experience severe
	affects, but, in any case, performance degradation is only
	present during testing with <em>atac</em>. After testing, the
	program should be recompiled without <em>atac</em> to obtain
	maximum execution efficiency. The affect of this is insignificant
	in most testing environments. However, in some time dependent
	applications a change in timing behavior may effect the execution
	of the program. There are means of reducing performance
	degradation, as discussed in</a> <a href=
	"instrumenting.html#203817">Section 5.1.3, <em>Selectively
	Instrumenting Software</em></a> (Linux) or <a href=
	"instrumenting.html#204433">Section 5.2.3, <em>Selectively
	Instrumenting Software</em></a> (Windows).
</p>

<p>
	<a name="630683">Using <em>atac</em> will also require
	additional disk space. This need arises from three sources: the
	increased size of the instrumented executable to be tested, the
	creation of <em>.</em>atac files during compilation, and the
	creation of a <em>.trace</em> file during test execution. The
	instrumented executable is approximately twice the size of a
	non-optimized, non-instrumented executable program. Each
	<em>.</em>atac file is at least as large as its corresponding
	<em>.c</em> file. The size of the <em>.trace</em> file generated
	during testing is a function of the total number of testable
	attributes to be covered and the size of the test set. When trace
	file compression is used, the <em>.trace</em> file grows very
	little unless a test actually improves coverage, in which case
	its growth is proportional to what is covered. Omitting trace
	file compression reduces test execution time but makes the
	<em>.trace</em> file grow more quickly, thereby costing
	additional disk space. Uncompressed <em>.trace</em> files can
	become rather large over time.</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="623862">
	3.6 How Does ATAC Fit into the Development Process?
</a></h2>

<p>
	<a name="623935"><em>atac</em> is
	primarily designed as a tool to support unit testing. That is,
	<em>atac</em> is to be used by developers in testing individual
	program units, or integrated collections of program units, within
	the development environment. The idea is to test each of the
	``software parts'' that make up a software product because
	constructing a system out of components that are thoroughly
	tested results in a high quality software product.</a>
</p>

<p>
	<a name="623936">The view that <em>atac</em> is a unit testing
	tool used by individual developers is largely one of
	practicality, but this need not always be the case. All the
	software components of an entire product can be instrumented and
	tested at the same time, if the product is of appropriate size.
	Also, some projects might designate a team of one or more
	individuals to coverage test all or part of the source code
	produced by its developers. Typically, it is most efficient for
	the author of a piece of software to do the coverage testing.
	This is because developing test cases that improve coverage is
	easier if one is very familiar with the source code under test.
	However, there is some flexibility in how <em>atac</em> is used
	to best satisfy the testing requirements and resource limitations
	of a given project.</a>
</p>

<p>
	<a name="623937"><em>atac</em> is not generally perceived as a
	system testing tool because system test focuses on verifying the
	behavior of software features, not on exercising constructs
	within the source code. Furthermore, it is likely that a system
	is too large and/or system testers have insufficient knowledge of
	a product's architecture to effectively perform coverage testing.
	Nevertheless, if the resources are available, it may be
	beneficial to instrument all or part of a product's source code
	using <em>atac</em>, and then run its system test suite. This
	provides a means of determining the overall code coverage of the
	system test suite.</a>
