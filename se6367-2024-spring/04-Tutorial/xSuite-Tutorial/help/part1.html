   <a name="788490">Testing is an essential part of software
  development. However, testing software can be both complex and
  expensive. Automated support for effective testing techniques
  makes it easier and cheaper to do a better job of testing and to
  produce higher quality software.</a></p>

  <p><a name="788446"><em>atac</em> (Automatic Test Analysis for C
  and C++) is a coverage analysis tool that allows testers to
  measure how thoroughly a program has been exercised by a set of
  tests. <em>atac</em> uses data flow coverage techniques to
  provide automated support for ``white-box'' testing. That is,
  <em>atac</em> allows testing based upon a program's structure, in
  addition to its requirements. <em>atac</em> measures how well a
  set of tests exercise a program by how well it covers flow
  control and data flow relationships within the program's code.
  Test sets that yield higher coverage do a better job of testing.
  <em>atac</em> provides a feedback mechanism to measure and guide
  the user to improve test coverage. Such feedback is very
  difficult, if not impossible, to obtain without a tool like
  <em>atac</em>.</a></p>

  <p><a name="788452"><em>xSuite</em> extends the functionality of
  <em>atac</em> by providing a graphical interfaces. The ease of
  use improvement of <em>xSuite</em> over <em>atac</em> is
  dramatic. Test cases are easy to create and coverage testing is a
  pleasure rather than a chore. Notwithstanding the marked
  superiority of <em>xSuite</em>, <em>atac</em> is a valuable tool
  when only an ASCII terminal is available. Moreover, much of the
  functionality of <em>atac</em> and <em>xSuite</em> are the same,
  so knowledge of one is valuable in understanding the other. For
  these reasons, this manual is as much about <em>atac</em> as it
  is about <em>xSuite</em>.</a></p>

  <p><a name="788468"><em>atac</em> and <em>xSuite</em> have many
  useful features, some of which are:</a></p>

  <ul>

    <li>Support for block, decision, and data flow coverage
    testing;<br>
    <br>
    <a name="788473"></a></li>

    <li>Display of coverage summary information;<br>

    <li>Display of uncovered source code;<br>

    <li>Guidance in creating effective tests;<br>
    <br>
    <a name="788476"></a></li>

    <li>Display of coverage overlap among test cases;<br>
