      xVue: A Tool for Effective Software
      Maintenance

    <p>
      <a name="769964">Maintenance and modification of legacy software systems
      are the most costly activities in the life cycle of a long-lived system.
      Central to this activity are techniques for effectively finding and
      modifying code which implements features. The tool, <em>xVue</em>, is tailored to this need and has a state of the
      art graphical user interface to allow the maintainer or programmer to
      quickly locate code that is associated with features of the system.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="773230">12.1 Background</a>
    </h2>
	<p>
		<a name="770688">Ideally, in a well-designed software system each
		program feature would be implemented in a single identifiable module; in
		practice, though, this is never the case. In the early development stage of
		a system, programmers may follow certain standards to ensure a clear
		mapping between each feature and its corresponding code segments. However,
		as development continues, it is likely that such traceability will often
		become the first casualty of the pressure to keep a system operational. As
		a result, program features are implemented over several non-adjacent
		subroutines which makes the features more difficult to locate and
		understand. Such delocalized programs can lead to serious maintenance
		errors.</a>
    <p>
      <a name="770386">In general, the first step towards software maintenance
      is to locate the code relevant to a particular feature. There are two
      methods of achieving this. First, a <em>systematic</em> approach can be
      followed which requires a complete understanding of the program behavior
      before any code modification. Second, an <em>as-needed</em> approach can
      be adopted, which requires only a partial understanding of the program so
      as to locate, as quickly as possible, certain code segments that need to
      be changed for the desired debugging/enhancement. The systematic approach
      provides a good understanding of the existing interactions among program
      features, but is often impractical in a real work environment due to the
      pressures of time and cost when working with large complicated software
      systems. On the other hand, the as- needed approach, although less
      expensive, may ignore some non-local interactions among the features and
      cause a program modification to result in disastrous side-effects. Thus,
      a need arises to identify those parts of the system that are crucial for
      the maintainer to understand. A possible solution is to read the
      documentation; however, in many cases, this may not be effective. The
      documentation may not exist; or even if it exists it may be incomplete,
      difficult to comprehend or not updated. Also, programmers/maintainers may
      be reluctant to read it. Perhaps a faster and a more efficient way of
      identifying the important segments of the code is to let the system speak
      for itself. It is this issue that the tool, <em>xVue</em>, attempts to address.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="770653">The <em>execution slice-based</em> technique is a
      solution which helps programmers and maintainers locate the
      implementation of different features in a software system. To find, for
      example, where the call forwarding feature is implemented in a telephone
      switching system, one would run a small, carefully selected, set of tests
      -- some that invoke the call forwarding feature and others that do not.
      Such tests are classified as <em>invoking</em> tests and
      <em>excluding</em> tests, respectively. Traces of program execution are
      analyzed to look for code components that were executed in the invoking
      tests but not in the excluding tests. Although this technique may not
      find all relevant code that makes up the call forwarding feature, it does
      identify a small number of program components that are unique to this
      feature. The identified code can then be used as a <em>starting
      point</em> for studying this feature. This is especially useful for those
      features that are implemented in many different modules in a large,
      complicated and poorly documented system.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="773873">It is important to note that code segments so identified
      rely heavily on the test cases used. Different sets of code may be
      identified by different sets of invoking and excluding tests. This
      implies poorly selected tests will lead to inaccurate identification by
      either including components that are not unique to the feature or
      excluding the ones that should not be excluded.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="773792">There are many ways in which execution traces of
      invoking and excluding tests may be compared to identify pieces of code
      that are related to a given feature, say <em>f</em>. One approach is to
      identify code that is executed by any invoking test case  but not
      executed by any excluding test case. Another approach is to identify
      program components that are executed by every invoking test case but not
      executed by any excluding test case. The latter approach identifies only
      those program components that are always executed when feature <em>f</em>
       is exhibited but not otherwise. Another, simpler, approach is to compare
      the execution trace of just one invoking test with that of one excluding
      test. To minimize the amount of relevant code identified, the invoking
      test selected may be the one with the smallest execution trace and the
      excluding test selected may be the one with the largest execution trace.
      Depending on how features are implemented in the program,
      programmers/maintainers may have to try all these approaches
	  in order to find the best set of code related to a given feature.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="773793"></a><a name="772283">Ideally, the excluding tests used
      should be as similar as possible to the invoking tests in order to filter
      out as much common code as possible. To illustrate how to select the
      invoking and excluding tests, consider the example code below. 
	  Suppose we want to find the code
      that is uniquely used to identify an <em>equilateral</em> triangle. We
      first construct an invoking test t1 that exhibits this feature and two
      excluding tests t2 and t3 which assign <em>isosceles</em> and
      <em>rectangle</em>, respectively, to <em>class</em>. Clearly, t1 is
      closer to t2 than t3. The difference between the execution traces of t1
      and t2 shows that only statements s10 and s13 are unique to this feature,
      whereas additional code such as the statements s3- s7 would also be
      identified should t3 be used in place of t2 as the excluding test.
      Furthermore, this example also indicates we do not even need to use the
      feature that identifies a <em>rectangle</em> to find code that is unique
      to <em>equilateral</em> triangle. The ability to identify program
      components unique to a feature without even knowing all the program's
      features greatly enhances the feasibility of using the execution slice
      technique to quickly highlight a small number of program components.

	  we need to choose a "heuristic" (described below).
	  To do so, we use the "<em>Heuristics</em>" drop down menu
	  on the far top right of the <em>xVue</em> pane. This

		<a name="782984"><em>xVue</em>

		With this heuristic (see</a> <a href="xvue.html#771593">Figure 
		12-12</a>) program components that are executed by any invoking
		test (<em>wordcount.2</em> and <em>wordcount.6</em> in our case),
		but not executed by any excluding test (<em>wordcount.3</em>,
		<em>wordcount.4</em> and <em>wordcount.7</em> in our case), are

		of <em>wordcount3</em>, <em>4</em> and <em>7</em>, are identified.

	  <a name="998579"></a><a name="781512">You can switch to the other

	  program components that are commonly executed by all invoking
	  tests (<em>wordcount.2</em> and <em>wordcount.6</em> in our
	  case), but not by any excluding test (<em>wordcount.3</em>,
	  <em>wordcount.4</em> and <em>wordcount.7</em> in our case), are
	  identified. In other words, program components that are in the
	  intersection of <em>wordcount.2</em> and <em>6</em>, but not in
	  the union of <em>wordcount.3</em>, <em>4</em> and <em>7</em>, are
	  identified. With the <em>Smallest-Largest</em> heuristic, program components that are

		To see the source display of the corresponding
