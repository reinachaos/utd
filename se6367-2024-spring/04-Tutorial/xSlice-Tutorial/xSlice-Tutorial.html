<p>(100 points)</p>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to use  <em><strong>xSlice</strong></em> to locate the bug in the source code based on coverage information. The program you need to work on is called <em><strong>wordcount</strong></em>.</p>
<h3 id="compile-the-program">Compile the program</h3>
<p>Compile the <em><strong>wordcount</strong></em> program with the instrumentation option:<br>
<code>atac cc -g -o wordcount_err main_err.c wc.c</code></p>
<p>Keep in mind that the <em><strong>wordcount_err</strong></em> you obtained here is the version with bug.</p>
<h3 id="execute-some-test-cases">Execute some test cases</h3>
<p>Execute the following three test cases against <em><strong>wordcount_err</strong></em>:</p>
<p>The 1st test case:</p>
<pre><code>./wordcount_err input1
</code></pre>
<p>The 2nd test case:</p>
<pre><code>./wordcount_err -w input1
</code></pre>
<p>The 3rd test case:</p>
<pre><code>./wordcount_err -w &lt; input1
</code></pre>
<h3 id="determine-which-test-cases-failed">Determine which test cases failed</h3>
<p>In the real-world, you need to determine which test cases failed by comparing the <strong>observed outputs</strong> (sometimes you even need to check the system behavior) with the <strong>expected outputs</strong>. In this tutorial, you don’t need to figure out the <strong>expected outputs</strong> since you can obtain them by running the test cases against a correct version of the program  – <em><strong>wordcount_correct</strong></em> – which does not have bug. Please keep in mind that this is not always the case in the real-world since you might not have a correct version of the program you are testing.</p>
<p>Let’s continue.</p>
<p>Compile the correct version of the program – <em><strong>wordcount_correct</strong></em> – and clean an environmental variable:</p>
<pre><code>cc -o wordcount_correct main.c wc.c
export ATAC_TRACE=
</code></pre>
<p>Now, execute the  three test cases against <em><strong>wordcount_correct</strong></em> like you just did for the faulty program.</p>
<pre><code>./wordcount_correct input1
......

./wordcount_correct -w input1
......

./wordcount_correct -w &lt; input1
......
</code></pre>
<p>Compare those outputs you observed from the <em><strong>wordcount_correct</strong></em> with those outputs you observed from the <em><strong>wordcount_err</strong></em>, and you should be able to determine which test cases failed against <em><strong>wordcount_err</strong></em>.</p>
<h3 id="use-xslice-to-help-you-identify-the-bug-in-the-source-code">Use xSlice to help you identify the bug in the source code</h3>
<p>Run the xSuite:</p>
<pre><code>xsuite wordcount_err.atacp
</code></pre>
<p>Switch the tool to xSlice mode by clicking menu “Coverage” -&gt; “xSlice”.</p>
<p>Open the trace file <em><strong>wordcount_err.trace</strong></em></p>
<p>Specify which tests passed and which failed.</p>

<p>Check the source code view in xSlice. The bug location should be highlighted by RED.</p>
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<p>Take a screenshot of the code highlighted in red and submit it to eLearning.<br>
The screenshot must show <em><strong>all your screen</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Name your screenshot to <em><strong>xSlice-Tutorial-FirstName-LastName.png</strong></em> (other file types, such as JPG, are allowed)</p>
<ul>
<li>Submission without the correct file name will not be accepted</li>
